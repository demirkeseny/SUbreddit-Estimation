16,1545351666,a84fii,False,3,1,"I just watched Metalhead last night. I really enjoyed it a lot, although I've been seeing that many people haven't enjoyed it so much. But that's not the point of this post. 

Here is the point. I think Bella could have beaten the dog in a different way and I wanted to discuss it with you all to see if you think it was possible. I left the title a little ambiguous to not spoil anything.

Let me first just say these dogs are truly badass killers that I believe have reached the peak of killing machine. Everything about it had a way to kill and survive in almost any situation. Of course, being automated machines, they need a power source, and I believe in this case, it was solar power. 

When Bella waited for the dog's batteries to die out, I thought that was a pretty good strategy. But she decided to keep running after. I think a better plan would have been to completely cover it with her coat so that it wouldn't get sunlight, and therefore it wouldn't be able to charge and wake up again. I think with that, she may have  been able to completely escape and not be followed. 

Not only that, there are two other alternatives, in my mind. Assuming that the dog cannot come back to life until it is charged, Bella could have taken the time to quickly find a rock or big branch, something that might have been able to destroy it with enough brute force, and destroy it. Or, secondly, she could have carried it in her coat, not allowing any sunlight to hit it, and bring it back to her base. Potentially learning about the dog, and learning to hack it which might be beneficial, and might be able to make it their own guard dog. 

That all being said I'm trying to think of the reasons why she might have just run off rather than any of those other options. 

First, the dog may have an emergency backup. Although a light touch, such as from a pebble or something, might not activate the emergency backup... rough housing it, picking it up, or its power absorbing source being covered may activate its emergency backup. I assume that being covered would activate its emergency backup after a certain amount of time so that it can quickly move to a place where it can charge. So, if she did anything to it, it's potential that the dog would have used its emergency backup and could have taken her out right then and there. 

Second, the dog may have an automatic self-defense system, all activated by being rough housed, picked up, etc. As we saw in the end, it shot off its trackers for other dogs to find Bella. There might be something similar, where it sends of trackers or self destructs in general. Although covering it up might have prevented a self-defense reaction, it might have been the irresponsible thing to do as someone walking by sees the jacket and picks it up not knowing a dog is under it. 

Lastly, maybe Bella knows (or believes) that she truly needed to destroy it because in general it seems like its tracking abilities are too good, and possibly being tracked to where humans are currently living would be too dangerous and basically a death wish to their entire group. As we saw, even without the tracker, it had other methods of tracking, such as picking up radio signals, or following tracks of blood. And she knows that it takes a lot to kill one of those things. It took two shotgun blows point blank in the face to finally kill it, not even dismantling it's last resort tracker tactic. Although she was running most of the time, she might have been looking for a better method to kill it, something that would have been a 100% kill, and even the single barrel shotgun might not have been reassuring enough. 

What do you all think? Was there a better method for Bella to take out the dog? Or different actions you might have taken? ",True,blackmirror,[Spoiler] Metalhead episode; analysis and better alternative discussion (don't read if you don't want the show to be spoiled)

175,1544726572,a5wapf,False,1,1,"I've posted this story theory as a comment reply but I'll make a general post too. This is my prediction for the upcoming 'Bandersnatch' episode, based on what we know from the production and the [cancelled game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brataccas#Story) that the episode likely takes its name from. Potential spoilers if any of this is correct.

I'm kind of expecting a story in the vein of the '[Polybius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polybius_(urban_legend))' urban legend, but with a narrative that somewhat mirrors that of the Bandersnatch game; the main character finds the unreleased game in a box that's been delivered to his store for the Christmas season. Curious, he discovers there's some kind of government/nefarious experiment behind it. The main character goes on the run from whoever was secretly behind the project - this may explain the prominence of the travel agency and related bus ad on set, and fleeing the country mirrors the ""fleeing Earth"" bit in the original game. Plus, just like a computer game we'll likely have some degree of control over the character's actions.

If it's a 'Polybius'-esque tale, the twist could be that playing the game inducts the main character unwillingly into a mind control experiment, hence why we've had some influence as a ""controller"" from a certain point in the story.

&amp;#x200B;

I think this would be a fantastic way to tell both a period technological tale, and to make use of the interactive format to spin a meta-narrative that doesn't rely on the simulation twist (whilst I love those and think Black Mirror handles them well, I do feel that the show needs to explore some fresher ideas this season).",False,blackmirror,'Bandersnatch' - a prediction

It's called Contraverse which makes short films (10-15 minutes) for VR. You can also use their mobile app to view them like any other youtube 360 videos if you don't have a headset.

In particular, the episode Contravision really made me think of Black Mirror. The premise without giving too much away is a not too distant future where everyone has AR glasses (like what Google Glass would have been), and it deals with the social implications of that.

As someone that's really been into VR lately the other two films currently available are good in their own right imo but you can safely skip those if you're really just looking for something Black Mirror-like.

229,1544478269,a505qn,False,2,1,"Disclaimer: I *love* Black Mirror, and this is in no way a hate post. Charlie Brooker is a genius. Also, this is my first post on this sub, so sorry if this seems ""fake woke"" or has already been said or whatever, but I'm hopped up on Addy and have an essay to procrastinate, so here goes.

Basically, I feel like if any of the BM alternate realities *did* exist, they probably wouldn't change the fundamental ways in which we live today. The only reason people think Black Mirror is scary is that it makes the reality of our current world seem new by adding technology we don't have yet, but our current society is just as ""scary"" as any in BM. I'll explain by going through each episode:

**The National Anthem**: Internet and/or political pressure causing people to do embarrassing/dumb shit for no reason? Think Tide Pod challenge, cinnamon challenge, ""Do it for the Vine"" type shit. The pig was put in there for shock value.

**Fifteen Million Merits**: The purpose of the treadmill in the episode is (I assume) just to power everyone else's virtual reality systems that have been built into the rooms. However, we are all already on a symbolic treadmill. No matter what your job is, at the end of the day, it has no meaning other than to help other people do their jobs. For example:

* doctors help people live longer, so they can keep on doing their jobs.
* most white-collar employees help corporations/NGOs/whatever organization they work for provide products and services to other people, so they can keep on doing their jobs.
* scientists/researchers discover things about our world — in essence figuring out more efficient ways of organizing our society — so people can more efficiently do their jobs
* entertainers, artists, and religious/spiritual figures give us ways of escaping from reality and constructing meaning within the capital-T Treadmill, so people can avoid thinking about how useless their jobs are.

Why would it be so different to just have everyone doing the same job — running on a treadmill — if that is what allows everyone else to continue doing their jobs?

**The Entire History of You**: \[go to bottom\]

**Be Right Back**: Psychologists have found that if you are close enough with someone, their personality literally becomes imprinted in your mind, meaning you instinctively feel their presence in the back of your mind even if they're not with you in person. This ambiguousness is why loss is painful at first, but gets better over time: it takes a very short time for your conscious mind to realize that they're gone, but a much longer time for your unconscious to realize this.

**White Bear**: Anyone who thinks this would be worse than how the actual criminal-justice system functions in most parts of the world has not done their research. Authorities fucking with prisoners' minds as punishment? Think solitary confinement, forced medication, physical and psychological torture by prison guards, etc.

**The Waldo Moment**: Populism has, and will always exist.

**The White Christmas**: \[go to bottom\]

**Nosedive**: Humans have evolved to be really good at making ourselves valuable to others (those that couldn't got left behind by the tribe, and died). Humans have also evolved to make snap judgements about others as a way of conserving cognitive energy (this is called System 1 thinking, and is the reason we stereotype others without even noticing). If you were scared by this episode, think about the following aspects of our current society: whether we get approached at a bar, or matched on a dating site, is based entirely on external appearance (don't lie to yourself); whether we get called back for a job interview is based entirely on a piece of paper; whether or not two people ""vibe"" is due to how well their world-views match up, which is most likely to occur between those who have occupied similar social, cultural, and economic positions in life. Humans have evolved to be fake motherfuckers, and that's always been the case. The more efficient our technology becomes, the more we start to realize this.

**Playtest**: When The Exorcist (1978) first came out, people literally threw up in the theater, and had to leave; it was branded the scariest movie of all time. If you watch it now, you'd laugh at how bad the special effects are. As scare technology becomes more sophisticated, so does our tolerance for it. Honestly, as I was watching this, all I could think about was how it would be a great tool for psychologist (exposure therapy, or gradually forcing people to confront the object of their fears, has been proven to be extremely effective for treating patients with severe phobias).

**Shut Up And Dance**: Blackmail has, and will always exist.

**San Junipero**: \[go to bottom\]

**Men Against Fire**: There are studies that show how, if someone has a deep prejudice towards a group of people, then the part of their brains that says ""I am observing another human"" won't light up when they think about that group. This is to say, dehumanization is already a very real and powerful psychological phenomenon born from our tribal mentality, and every society that has successfully committed genocide has done so by first indoctrinating people with the message that their victims are, in one way or another, non-human (and thus disposable). We *could* develop a technology that makes committing mass genocide easier, but it wouldn't change much.

**Hated in the Nation**: The idea that technology could allow one crazy person to kill millions of people with the click of a button? Sis, nuclear weapons.

**USS Callister**: \[go to bottom\]

**Arkangel**: \[go to bottom\]

**Hang the DJ**: \[go to bottom\]

**Metalhead**: Drone warfare exists.

**Black Museum**: \[go to bottom\]

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;!Bottom!&lt; I grouped some episodes together that had the same central theme, for the sake of not repeating myself. 

The central theme of **The Entire History of You**, **Arkangel**, and **Crocodile** is: What happens when technology challenges our ability to keep our thoughts private?

* **The Entire History of You** and **Arkangel** have similar plots: an abusive person is obsessed with the thought that their loved one could be hiding something from them, and futuristic technology allows them to go into the other's memories to confirm their fears; however, in doing so, they end up driving the person away. When you *actually* think about this, though, you realize that the technology wasn't the problem — it was the people. The jealous boyfriend and over-protective mother both exist today (think people who go through their partner's phone when they're not around, or parents with apps that let them monitor their children's texts). The technology only made it easier for them to feed into insecurities that they would have had anyway, and honestly, both the girlfriend/daughter are probably better off now that they know how abusively paranoid their boyfriend/mother was.
* **Crocodile** is slightly different from the other two, in that it is now institutions that are extracting people's memories. Using a combination of DNA sequencing, network data collection, and sociological profiling, it is already possible for powerful institutions to predict almost everything about an individual's behavior, not to mention modern forensic science making it almost impossible to commit a violent crime and get away with it. Big Brother's *been* watching, y'all.

The central theme of **The White Christmas**, **San Junipero**, **USS Callister**, **Hang the DJ**, and **Black Museum** is: What happens when technology advances to the point where consciousness can be computed?

* **San Junipero** and **Hang the DJ** are the optimistic scenarios. Computers have advanced to the point where they can create simulations of real-life humans, and people use this to make a utopia for simulated humans (San Junipero) or to make dating easier for real ones (Hang the DJ). The funny thing is, their endings send the opposite message: in San Junipero, the real human dies for the sake of her computer self, whereas in Hang the DJ, the computerized ""selfs"" are killed off for the sake of their real-life version. Kind of blurs the line between simulation and real life, and raises the question of whether or not there's even a difference.
* **The White Christmas**, **USS Callister**, and **Black Museum** are the pessimistic scenarios. Computers have advanced to the point where they can create simulations of real-life humans, and people use this to create digital slaves (The White Christmas) or just objects for sadistic satisfaction (USS Callister and Black Museum). Like before, this kind of blurs the line between simulation and real life, and raises the question of whether or not there's even a difference. If there existed technology that allowed, for example, the consciousness of a prisoner to get electrocuted over and over, then it would have to consistently recreate his consciousness as it was first ""copied"" from the real-life human. Thus, every time the electrocution went over the time limit (and the algorithm had to reset), this would be the equivalent of creating an entirely new consciousness — the faulty one would cease to exist. If it were any comfort for whatever consciousness was sitting in that chair at the time, then, they would only have to exist for as long as it would take for another copy to replace them. ALSO, the idea of a consciousness ""frozen in time"" is impossible, because there is no way for our brain to form a consciousness without neurons interacting with each other to create our self-image (which is a process that, by definition, takes time). So, hanging the keychain of the guy ""eternally being electrocuted"" on her  mirror as she drives away in Black Museum is the equivalent of hanging a dead person's brain — all the parts may be there, but without change there is no consciousness.

What Kenny was doing was horrible, and maybe even it should be made public so that he can get help and stop. But he is still a kid himself. Maybe he is legally an adult (this can be interpreted differently across countries and cultures), but he has the mindset of a child. We don’t know anything about him except that he is a pedophile. That’s a touchy subject, so people naturally don’t want to think about it that long. Kenny could have been a confused kid, knowing what he was doing wasn't right, and possibly want to change. We might never know. But writing Kenny off as scum, instead of considering why he might be like that, to what extent he indulges, and if he wants to stop, ultimately perpetuates the problem. People are quicker to damn than wanting to rehabilitate. There’s a lot that is unknown about pedophilia because we often see them as “evil” people instead of people having mental disorders. This isn’t to justify the behavior, rather to understand it so that we can correct it.

The Hacker entity in the show was self-righteous. Their victims ranged from “Criminal to embarrassing”. They forced the “bad people” they were manipulating into committing crimes hurting innocents, so they are not a good force. But some people forget all of this. They see the troll face at the end as “bad people” getting their just desserts, instead of a vigilante causing city-wide havoc. I think the ""Hacker"" in the episode represents people who see others commit acts that they interpret as ""evil"", and forget that they are flawed as well. They go to extreme lengths to expose them and be heroes, ignoring all of the mayhem they cause in the process. The point of this episode wasn't ""child porn is bad, beware of cam hackers"". That is an extreme and does not apply to most people. The message in the show was to show the danger of generalizing ""good"" and ""bad"" people, and what self-righteous indignation can bring",True,blackmirror,I feel like some people miss one of the Biggest Points of “Shut Up and Dance”

So my wife loves TV. Very open to all genres, all eras, ect. Nothing is really off limits for her except one thing... hurting  kids. You don't fuck with kids. It just disturbs her to the core. So... I watch a several episodes of Black Mirror and was RAVING about it, and due to all the additional people out there giving it good reviews she wanted to watch it with me. I for some reason didn't watch them in order and at the time had seen some great ones like Nosedive &amp; 15 Million Merits and have also seen Anthem which to each their own.. but I hated that one. So... knowing not all were good I wanted to watch one with her that I knew was good. But she insisted we watch something I haven't. So... we picked White Bear. The entire episode was about a child murderer. She was like, ""What the fuck am I watching... This is horrible..."" This is the show you are raving about? I quickly explained that this episode is not the norm and every episode is different.

I asked her to please try a another episode, she agrees... White Christmas. That sounds cheery right? It's about a child murderer. At this point... I don't know what to say. She's just looking at me like I'm trolling her and I can't blame her for whatever she is thinking at this point. She tells me she thinks she done with the show. It's just not for her.

A week later she wants to give it another shot. I INSIST we watch one that I have seen (at this point I have several under my belt) and know what to expect. But, again... she wants something that I haven't seen so I don't have to rewatch anything. She's awesome like that. We pick Shut Up And Dance. She's loving it, were both loving it, 10 min. left and no kids have died. I'm in the clear... and he's a pedophile. She just looked at me and I was in complete disbelief.

Great episode of ""Shut up and dance"" was ruined with the idea that, how was his mother able to see, what was he masturbating to? If it was a webcam recording his face jerking off, how could a webcam at the same time record what was on the screen. 

White Christmas - the pick up helper moment. When she poisons the guy and than demands to pour more into his mouth, OUT OF NOWHERE in the bedroom she takes out a funnel to pour a drink into his mouth. She wasn't holding funnel when entering the bedroom and having a funnel laying around in the bedroom is not a usual thing last time i checked.

Second,aside from said torture,which can be equated to a smaller scale of ""White bear"", he didn't really do all that bad. 

Yeah everything ended up like shit,but he didn't make the shit happen,he just gave people to option to use new tech,which was supposed to help, that made shit happen because of how THEY used it.

Hot takes:

The banality of white collar office life shines through in the workplace of the exercise bikes where all efforts power the society's economy: advertising.

Via cryptocurrency, aka intangible rewards to labor and easily penalize-able behavior modification, mandatory advertising viewership is regulated via ocular sensors, low culture pervades all varieties of entertainment, and the only option outside the 9-5 is overnight celebrity.

The garbage of pornography, violence,  and entitlement and cruelty is proscribed through mandatory viewership. All of these trash tv options are cheap sources of dopamine rushes and are all time wasters voluntarily consumed in our society presently.

The true escape of celebrity dually details the horrors of Hollywood.  Drugs are maximally available with Hollywood doctors, compliance and self worth are directly related to popularity which is herein being evaluated by  consumers of low culture garbage, aka why would you value the opinion of the perverted masses in the first place?  For beautiful things and beautiful surroundings.  

Abi's decline from innocent songbird to insta-whore is disturbingly parallel to the careers of Disney talents, teenage pop stars, and young female celebrity in general. No matter their talent, the demand for their skill set will always be trumped by nudity and sexual appeal. This I'll categorize as the virgin sacrifice.

There is a ""valley of the dolls"" horror in her mistreatment throughout a Hollywood system that chews up and spits out any sexual appeal. 

The eternity on the bikes manufactures an inescapable side effect of fitness and vitality that would ensure any sexual appeal.  The economy of consumables is powered by the kinetic energy of the bikes. The human batteries are stigmatized to value fitness as reinforced by the social hierarchy. The lazy and underemployed do the grunt work of the white collar yet must maintain their free shelter / cell and have the same mandatory entertainment and viewership mandates.

Garrett Scholes and Ted Kaczynski shared some parallels.

Both were technical geniuses. Scholes a genius programmer and Kaczynski a genius mathematician.

Both did completely apprehensible things by killing people to get their messages across.  

Both released manifestos. 

Scholes:

""Consumed by rage at the thoughtless abuse spread on a daily basis via the Internet, Garret's increasingly aggressive views on morality eventually became the subject of a ninety-six page manifesto entitled The Teeth Of Consequences, lambasting the mob culture of Internet users hiding behind a wall of anonymity. Eventually, Garret concocted a scheme to teach the world a lesson and punish anyone who misused social media for such destructive purposes. To that end, he used his access to the ADI program to modify the system, albeit so subtly that nobody at Granular ever noticed his alterations.""

Kaczynski:

""35,000-word essay Industrial Society and Its Future [...] Industrial Society and Its Future begins with Kaczynski's assertion: ""The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race.""

It goes back to the man who set him up with the cookies.

His wife blocked him, as with his child.

He had no say and couldn't do anything.

He was **exiled** from either of their lives.

So does this world implicate that the child bearers have **ALL THE SAY**?

436,1543370610,a11n5c,False,16,1,"I have read up on the theorized chronology of Black Mirror from several websites and they all seem stupid. The ones I have seen go by easter eggs and not the advancement of technology and the degradation of ethics that would lead to dystopia, which to me is much more telling of when specific episodes happened in relation to each other. 

Anyways, I personally like to think Metalhead and Fifteen Million Merits happen at roughly the same time, which I theorize are the furthest in the future in all of Black Mirror. I guess this is less of a theory and more of just a hypothesis, but the degradation of ethics and descent into dystopia are most similar in those 2 episodes. Those that for one reason or another live outside of the society established in Fifteen Million Merits (which there should obviously be SOME) may be the ones shown in Metalhead. The dogs may have been created to exterminate those outside of the advanced dystopia they created. 

Clearly (as shown in Men Against Arms), societies have largely abandoned ethics and have no qualms with committing genocide, so the mass extermination of those outside of the system shouldn't be too far fetched.

444,1543287305,a0qm2n,False,11,1,"Personally, I loved San Junipero for various reasons that have all been said before.

The most common criticism I read against it is that it's not very ""Black Mirrory"" and that it's just a basic love story and is lacking in the dark notes that other episodes have. In this post, I want to offer a counterpoint to this stance 

I'll start with the Quagmire. Some theories have guessed that the people here might even be subject to some sort of glitch, but I think the scarier angle is the human one. If you're in San Junipero, you can try anything and you have nothing to lose. You won't lose your job, or build tolerance to drugs, or injure yourself or anything bad. I think even if I were a ""tourist"", I'd enjoy just letting go and exploring things I perhaps wouldn't in real life at a place like Quagmire. Not everyone there is necessarily weird people who live entirely by hedonism. On the other hand, the people hopelessly trying to feel something are there and can't be ignored. We don't need to have the sci-fi setting to imagine this type of thing: some people do drugs in a safe, recreational way, maybe smoking a joint occasionally with friend, whilst others are always chasing their next high, discarding their morals and going to terrible lengths just to score. The Quagmire scared me because I've heard horror stories and I've got friends that I worry about, who maybe dance a little too close to the line when it comes to having fun. I worry that if I were in San Junipero and I had nothing to lose, I'd fall into that lifestyle of ruthless hedonism too easily.

And that's not even taking into account the concept of forever. Some of the most horrifying concepts for me in Black Mirror have been around endless torture, like cookies experiencing lengths of time that I can't begin to fathom. Even if I set out to live in moderation, ""forever"" is so ineffably vast that surely eventually I'd become desensitised to life and end up seeking out more. Along those lines, is ending up like the people in the Quagmire inevitable? 

One thing I loved about the dynamic between Kelly and Yorkie, I found their romance very authentic. Thinking about them being together though, it makes me uneasy. Most relationships burn out even if they start out sweet and hopeful. Kelly chose to pass over, largely for Yorkie, but what if they fall out of love and break up, is there anything to stay for anymore? Couples who are together for decades and are only separated by death are rare, but they happen. I wonder whether any relationship could last the pressures of infinite time together. It's said that it's possible to quit out of San Junipero if you don't like it, but would doing that be like a second death? This links into the recurring question of AI rights and whether a cookie's feelings are real and important, but let's consider it from the perspective of someone inside SJ, like Kelly. Being a full timer would inevitably lead to more connections with people, not just the romantic link with Yorkie. If she quit the program, it would hurt those simulated people just like a real life suicide would. I've been in a bad place before and I've been close to noping out. After all, humans are meaningless on the cosmic scale, so it doesn't even matter if my family are sad about it. I've always stopped myself though, because even though I know humans don't matter, their feelings matter to me, it feels like it matters and I couldn't bear the idea of hurting them. I think even if cookie-me believed that San Junipero wasn't real and I wasn't really alive, I couldn't stop myself from caring about my cookie-friends. It's not as simple as it seems to quit the program. Even if nothing big happened to make me want to quit, what if I just got weary of ""forever""? How would you decide when enough is enough, when to quit?

In the end, quitting might not be your choice. Those big server farms looked like they'd take up a lot of space and a lot of energy. The day might come when maintaining them is taking too much resources and they need to be deactivated. I find this angle eerie because it feels very real; it's plausible that we might have a San Junipero type situation in my lifetime. People debate AI rights now as an abstract thing, but I don't think it's too far away that we'll have to debate it as a practical manner. Do cookies have rights? If we had to deactivate units starting from the oldest ones, how much in-world time is ""enough""? Should we warn the virtual people inside of their impending non-existence? If we consider cookies to be sentient, should we consider the default is to transfer someone's consciousness, if they haven't expressed a preference? Family can stop you from passing over, but could they force you to pass over? If I was likely to end my life, I could be admitted to hospital and prevented from doing so, having my free will removed to preserve my safety. If cookies are deemed to be a new form of life, should passing over be enforced (and one's ability to delete oneself removed)? If a negligent engineer caused a server failure, how severe should the punishment be and would any compensation be owed (such as to family of the lost cookies). 

I think I enjoyed this episode so much *because* of the happy ending. If anything, to me, the ending made it more dark in the way I've come to expect from Black Mirror. Underneath the happy smile I had when watching them drive into the sunset, I felt a quiet sense of unease at these points I've mentioned, which was only amplified when juxtaposed with otherwise feeling happy and satisfied at the cute love story. It's like how  ""uncanny valley"" can often be creepier than something explicitly scary; there's a sense of wrongness that comes from mostly everything being right, but not quite. I think it's this sense of internal conflict that's driven me to scour forums for different opinions and subsequently assert my own on the matter.

I am thinking that Beth's dad was unaware that Joe thought he was the father of the little girl, not Tim.  All of the Dad's mannerisms have always struck me as odd, but I always thought he was just more of a dick, not confused.  

&amp;#x200B;

Reasons:  Though Beth is obviously close enough with her father, I think this is a strong likelihood that should wouldn't get into much details about her sex life, probably just gave him the quick version of ""I was seeing someone else and got pregnant.  Joe got pretty upset about it and it was a bad breakup, in fact I am a little scared if him"".

&amp;#x200B;

Looking at it from this perspective, Joe isn't some estranged father trying to connect with his perceived daughter.  He is just a crazy ex boyfriend, possibly abusive, try to stalk and get back together with his ex.  I'm thinking Beth never let him in on that Joe thought it was his, or possibly not even that she blocked him.  His first reaction of ""what are you doing here, Beth's dead"", seemed very confused, but he couldn't seem to come up with any other logical reason he would be there if it wasn't to see Beth.  When Joe said ""I just want to see my daughter"", the father quickly responds ""that's Beth's daughter."", not clarifying that it wasn't his, there still seemed to be an air of confusion to it, like ""That's Beth's daughter, why would you be looking for your daughter here??"" and finally he said ""Is this about the letters?  Because I threw they away..."", at first this seemed very cold and callous, but when you factor in him not knowing there is A question of paternity, then it is a reasonable response to a crazy ex who just can't let go of an old relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

 There's actually ***two versions*** of the consciousness transfer from what I can see. The one in White Christmas was outlawed and the one in San Junipero was legalised. if you watch carefully the real people who participate in the transfer in White Christmas behave differently to how they behave normally before the transfer; it's very subtle but it's there. so it being outlawed would make even more sense since the technique isn't perfected and there's good reason to believe they are incarcerating themselves (their soul/spirit) by participating.

&amp;#x200B;

In a few other episodes we get a lot of clones of certain characters in the digital realm. this could have been an early version of the transfer which involved DNA copying. the White Christmas transfer involved machines connected to the temple. first research for Soul transfer could have began from Playtest, where they gather data about time dilation through emotional neurology.  

&amp;#x200B;

 This moves on to White Bear. Victoria Skillane may be one of the first souls transferred into a digital reality. the title being called White Bear becoming expanded on in Black Museum, and through Black Museum understanding why they took the risks they took in the episode Motorhead...  

&amp;#x200B;

The San Junipero underlying theme is the question whether they are truely transfering themselves into the digital reality using the government supported technique or if it's just a copy of themselves. key points: guy talking about there being two endings to Bubble Bobble. Kelly questioning the whole thing and whether there is a real world afterlife or not. also the juxtaposed ending (two endings) one where she joins Yorkie in the digital reality and one where she is just dead (no afterlife?).  I'd like to think San Junipero is set in a future (cos it does seem like it's the furthest in the timeline) where they have a firm understanding about soul tranference from research of the White Christmas scenario. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

How? Well, let's address his initial offence, pedophilia. Despite how horrid this crime may be logically he could easily get out of this. Simply deny he was looking at children. Even though there is a video, they would have had to combine the webcam footage &amp; the screen recording in some sort of video editing program. Now, why would Kenny post a video of himself committing a crime, then Rob &amp; bank, &amp; finally kill someone in a dual in the forest? This whole situation doesn't make any sense &amp; any reasonable judge or jury would understand that. Who's to say that someone didn't merely combine the video of Kenny masturbating with a random video of child pornography? Well anyone can do that, I can easily combine 2 video files or overlay one video file with another, it's simple &amp; all YouTubers who use a webcam do it.

&amp;#x200B;

Though Kenny is in a trial now &amp; the police could get a warrant to view internet activity logs from his ISP, this could confirm that Kenny was visiting a child pornography site unless he used a VPN, or the Tor network to access it. Though assuming he used no such privacy, once the police realize there is a larger organization behind all this (simply viewing Kenny's text messages). They will find he was blackmailed into doing these actions, luckily for Kenny that older man's hotel address was listed. When the police find out who was there &amp; interview him they will see that he was also blackmailed. Now Kenny has a witness who also has evidence about the situation. So all Kenny has to do it say the hackers (since they already hacked his computer, most likely with a RAT (remote administration tool)) connected to the child pornography site via a backdoor on Kenny's laptop to create false evidence of Kenny viewing illegal content.

&amp;#x200B;

Now you may say, all this is great though Kenny still committed armed robbery, &amp; murdered someone. Well luckily for Kenny under English common law any illegal actions committed under duress is a completely valid defence. Meaning since Kenny was forced to rob the bank, &amp; kill the man in the woods. (Which could also classify as some form as self-defence since he attacked Kenny first, though Kenny would have no way to prove this other than his word) The fact that the gun used in the robbery was unloaded or entirely fake for that matter, would also go to help Kenny's case in proving he had no intention of hurting anyone else at that time. A prosecutor might try to use the fact that he literally murdered someone an hour later to say he did have the intent to harm if necessary at the bank, though this would be disputable. Also, his actions &amp; body language such as crying, pissing himself, hesitant voice, &amp; generally lack of planning (as seen when the banker actually had to ask him for the bag &amp; he was lost for words for a moment) after a behaviour analyst reviews the security footage they could easily determine that Kenny was not doing this on his own accord.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So in summary, the child pornography is a forgery, &amp; he acted under duress &amp; in self-defence.

So I'm thinking that the girl in metalhead has gone through some sort of white bear punishment system for a crime that she's committed (no idea what) but she has passed away after being subjected to it for years, and so they have transferred her consciousness to a different afterlife simulation (I'm convinced it's a simulation due to the bleakness of the environment and the addressless letters in the house she enters) and is subjecting her to the same sort of sadistic torture as they would were she still alive.
I'm thinking that the whole thing is just a repeating simulation with lots of little digital versions of her made to think she's been there for years (also a link to White Christmas) and has to complete a task and get away from these torturous dogs that are chasing her but ultimately it always ends in the same way, with her being shot with the trackers etc.
Another hint is that there is a San junipero postcard in the house she goes in, sort of like a smack in the face of 'look where you could've been if you'd have been a good person'.
The box of white bears at the end was one of the main things that got me thinking of this because it seemed like a glaringly obvious hint at the whole premise of that episode.

I mean just being able to play back memories from your childhood would be a blast, and it's available at any time with just the press of a button. Seems awesome to me. And when it came to the government, I wouldn't mind the memory scanner from Crocodile if it meant catching more people like Mia and putting them away for good.

And in terms of things I'd hate, it'd probably have to be either the tracking device from Arkangel or any of Rolo's devices from Black Museum, especially the device that allows you to have a loved one sitting in your head. That would drive me insane. If I were Jack, I'd have let Carrie stay in a coma or pass, while keeping the little light device so we could communicate.

685,1541622370,9v314m,False,5,1,"What struck me about ""The Waldo Moment"" is the progression of Jamie/Waldo. Lots of people have drawn comparisons to Trump, but what I see here is Internet trolls. 

At the beginning of the episode, Jamie is hurting from professional and romantic failures. He's clearly depressed and isolated, so much so that he should probably be in treatment. The only time he's energized is when he gets in the small, darkened booth with his joysticks and screens, isolated from the world, and performs as Waldo, allowed to vent his frustration and rage at successful people like Monroe and other politicians, yet always ready to hide behind the excuse of ""I'm just a stupid cartoon bear. Don't take me seriously."" 

Like Sacha Baron Cohen's Ali G or Bruno characters, Waldo is a trickster who mocks the powerful, generally punching up. There's a certain value to that. It's also ratings gold, as his producer says, enough to put Waldo into the by-election alongside Monroe and Gwendoline. 

By fluke, Jamie had a one-night fling with Gwendoline, and he clearly invests way too much into it. When she's forced to push him away, he's hurt all over again. 

In the debate with Monroe and Gwendoline, Monroe goes full ad hominem, not on Waldo the cartoon trickster, but on Jamie the vulnerable human, calling him a failure. That, plus the sting of Gwen's rejection, pushes Jamie in his box over the edge, and he retaliates the only way he can. Not only does he insult Monroe, but he brings up the Conservative politician who was recently discovered in a sexual scandal. And then he goes scorched earth on Gwen, revealing that she doesn't expect to win and is just there to build her resume. 

These are valid points, revealing how much of politics is a show. But then things take a sinister turn, with the man from ""the agency"" saying that Waldo can become a political tool instead of something to tear the system down. And the producer Jack says that he doesn't need Jamie to do Waldo. Tellingly, Jack shows he can do the voice and the catchphrases, instead of actually saying anything. 

When Jamie quits and leaves the safety of his booth, Jack immediately takes over. While he can do the Waldo voice, what he does is immediately turn to violence, paying people to attack Jamie. At the election results, Waldo does the same, showing ""his"" decline from truth-telling trickster to rabble-rouser. 

The conclusion sequence shows that, just like in ""Fifteen Million Merits"", the criticism of the system can be assimilated into the system. 

For every performer like Stephen Colbert or Sacha Baron Cohen who act as tricksters to reveal the truth, there are a hundred thousand Internet trolls in their darkened booths with their screens and joysticks who just want to kick over the anthills and see the chaos. And there are people from ""the agency"" waiting to weaponize them.

It's been about nearly a year since I've seen this episode, and despite only watching for the second time last night, that single viewing maintained an extremely strong impression on me that there were very few scenes I did not have near complete recall of in my second viewing. As with most obsessions, I hunted for interpretations similar to my own, and while I have found some striking parallels, they still didn't mirror my own. Perhaps I didn't dig hard enough, but I decided to write my own interpretation for anyone to critique and/or add to. This is long, and I put my conclusion last if you don't care for the build up or if you get bored reading a semi-structured essay.

&amp;#x200B;

**Virtual reality and Alzheimer's: Shattering Reality**

The variety of written interpretations and video analyses capture pieces of what it meant to me. If we take a step back  and think about the episode as a whole, we witness something very simple: for Cooper, his brain is wired to immediately connect his mother to death. Without getting into Terror Management Theory, I think the narrative has successfully communicated how rapidly the brain can process information. We're often given very specific time points when we're  supposedly in the real world. These time points are there to break the fourth wall, just like witnessing Cooper on a security camera. None of these events actually take place if we consider the ending to be firmly placed in the real world, but we're quick to cite those numbers despite a general consensus that Cooper's death is real. I contend that all of it was contained in the game, especially given all indications that Cooper escaped the game were merely red herrings. After all, the episode gets into Cooper's second biggest fear, his fear of losing his grip on reality via Alzheimer's. Black Mirror is an anthology series that provides a cautionary tale of how technology can be used against us if used carelessly, and many searched for that moral message in this episode (something something singularity). Yet, we already have something that is being used against us, and it existed long before the dawn of modern man: the mind.   


The brain is extremely powerful in that it's able to decode what should be entirely useless input into something meaningful, codifying useful stimuli into symbols. These words on a screen mean absolutely nothing to anyone who  doesn't have a remote grasp on the English language. For those who are completely fluent, each word and each punctuation formulated into their proper arrangements have meaning. Language is simply a given, despite literacy being a rather recent occurrence in human existence. Despite languages originating orally, it is faster to read this text on a screen than to have someone recite it to you aloud. That's how strong the connections in the human brain are to decipher symbols (in the form of language) into something meaningful. It is so fast it simply occurs below the level of awareness. I bring up language because of the use of Japanese in this episode. For those who watched it without any understanding of Japanese language, the parts conveniently not subtitled in English are just lost on us. Only when the clarification is needed do we have our precious translated subtitles.   


**Communication shapes reality**

Mom = Death. This is the language only Cooper knows, and the first third of the episode uses traditional storytelling to convey this idea. We get a lot of insight into Cooper from this standard narrative. He is a young man who embarks on a backpacking trip across the world collecting experiences. He's a bit obnoxious and fratty, coming across as the standard naive, white  American guy  often encountered by those living outside the states. He bumbles around making lame and awkward jokes that can be cringe-inducing, and, initially, appears devoid of depth. Then we get a window into who he is when talking to Sonja. Allowing himself to be vulnerable, we get a glimpse into his mind with his words. From being literally stabbed by a bully to having to take care of his father slowly mentally decaying until his death. We feel some limited empathy for him, but the impact this experience has on him is still lost on those of us who haven't been in his shoes. So the plot moves with the delicious theme of the anthology hanging over our heads. Virtual reality!  


The traditional narrative is slowly thrown out for a Lynchian fever dream type surreal experience, but in baby steps. Cooper is implanted with the microchip referred to as a mushroom. Ah, a video game reference, we're in a video game related episode and anticipated that. Well, yeah, but it's obviously a direct reference to psychedelic mushrooms, and Cooper's brain is literally being manipulated by a mind altering device. Mr. Fearless ignores all sense and reason by going along with all of this without hesitation, quickly signing a contract without careful reading. The narrative has now changed. Given all the tools we need, everything that follows were built up from overt clues given to us throughout the first third of the episode so we can, without conscious effort, tie them directly to Cooper. Cooper now plays whack-a-mole. 

&amp;#x200B;

We frequently given some sense of time, and we see what Cooper sees, then we see the real world from a security camera. These are clues to drive home that Cooper has an altered sense of reality. Of course we know they are clues, because time is an objective measurement and security cameras record things as they are. These clues are drilled into us from birth as symbols codified into our brains, and therefore, as savvy detectives, we seek these clues out to separate ourselves from Cooper who is clearly hallucinating with the help of the mushroom. The chip is what is deceiving Cooper by altering his sense of reality, but his caretaker, Katie, guides him into this new reality as she rapidly improves graphics of the mole into something life-like. The comforting sterile, controlled environment and clinical way in which Katie speaks gives him a sense of calm even though she has direct access to his brain. It is time to meet Saito.

Saito's English is fine at first, but doesn't seem to understand Cooper when he describes how super fun the whack-a-mole game is, fortunately Katie is there to translate for us. No subtitles are needed, because she must be reiterating what Cooper said to Saito. Then Saito's English exponentially improves as he speaks. I thought this was weird in my first viewing, but I quickly brushed it aside. However, this is what many think of as a clue to ground us back to reality. Cooper isn't actually in that room talking to Saito at all, he's dying in a chair. Onward to the haunted mansion.

&amp;#x200B;

**Foreshadowing**

In Cooper's mind, this is building up to a horror simulator based on his limited knowledge of Saito's work. The events from Sonja to his foray into the facility primed both us and him for specific expectations. Our previous experience with narratives is that there can be a lot of subtle foreshadowing of events that will transpire. You could say we were trained by our entertainment to soak in clues to help predict the outcome of events that follow, or to enjoy the medium again by catching the clues we initially missed that put all the pieces together. And, predictably, the events that transpire in the haunted mansion fulfilled the prophecy: the haunted mansion itself, a spider (extremely common fear, it was on a monster movie on the plane, and on someone's t-shirt), creepy character model from the horror game a graphics artist was working on, the creepy character turns into the bully from high school, bully and giant spider hybrid (double the horror), and then the fun stuff.

Sonja comes to save the day. Sonja is player on Cooper's fears, things we probably felt he should have been afraid of all along by giving free reign of his mind to complete strangers. Cooper ignored his gut on his travels, and the only price he really paid for was his bank account being locked due to identity theft. This eventually morphs into his suspicions it was the complete stranger he met in a foreign land, Sonja. She could have done anything to him at his most vulnerable state: asleep in her apartment. These are common horror tropes used that clue us into the dangers to come. Horror movies typically start out with the protagonists engaging in a variety of sins, and usually all but a few, at best, survive. We were primed for this moment. Then Sonja lays on the guilt, he should have called his mom, and by calling her instead (symbol of his reckless trip), he put himself in grave danger. He survives Sonja's attack. Keep in mind there are always security cams with a clock to ground us back into reality. This is going on in Cooper's head, we're firmly in reality.

&amp;#x200B;

**Mom = Death**

 It was only a matter of time he succumbed to his second biggest fear, Alzheimer's. Prior, he's worried about his mom being in the room where the access point is (we're being reminded it's still a game). Cooper succumbs to the mushroom as foreshadowed by Sonja's remark about the singularity, ""it's when computers learn to outsmart man."" Saito and Katie speak Japanese (not subtitled) while Cooper succumbs to Alzheimer's, this coincides with Cooper asking, ""who are you?"" Saito and Katie switch back to spoken English, Cooper starts to regain his sense of self and uses the safe word, ""stop."" He's pulled out of the game and we're quoted a number of how short the time was from the initial plug in. He reluctantly goes back home, but then lets out a laugh that communicates, to us, he overcame his fears, then calls for his mom as he enters the house. His mom doesn't recognize him, she has Alzheimer's. She always had it. It's only a matter of time until she dies, too, just like his dad. All that would be left is him, alone, with Alzheimer's rapidly losing his sense of self until he dies. And he did. We see him in the chair dead as a result of the interference from the phone. **The equipment measured the precise time of during the loading of the software into the mushroom at 0.04 seconds, which is the speed the  symbol, mom, is identified as death in Cooper's brain.** Saito is in different clothes and he has a wedding ring on. Japanese is spoken with subtitles in English this time for our clarification. This is reality, and Cooper is really dead. This is before the actual software was even loaded into the chip. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Cooper was deceived?**

Cooper may not be dead, we can go back to good old fashioned clues. Cooper anticipates that something may go wrong because he suffers from guilt. On the flight away from home, Cooper is told to turn off his phone. In the simulation, the camera pans on the screen on the seat in front of him stating to turn off all electronic devices, echoed by audio stating it (foreshadowing?). It is entirely possible Cooper is still just sitting there in the chair at Saito's office, having been explicitly told that the function of the game is to scare him using his own mind, because, ""surviving death in a safe environment is liberating."" So the goal is to convince Cooper the simulation is over to finally learn what his greatest fear is by approaching his mother in what he thinks is reality. Once the AI from the mushroom determined it, he enters another layer of reality, this time dying clearly before the software was even able to load. Cooper witnesses his death, perhaps as a soul if Cooper is religious (the software would know if he is), and Saito enters the room in a different outfit with a wedding ring, sufficiently convincing Cooper he died prior to the start of the simulation altogether.  Note that it was electronic interference that caused the crash, harking back to his flight away from home (why would the warning be emphasized so blatantly in his life flashing before his eyes experience?). Remember that Katie was only concerned with what Cooper could use to transmit information out of the room, then had him sign an NDA. Why would she not stress that electronic interference from the phone could be dangerous? It's curious that the NDA mysteriously had the signature page absent, and Katie subtly taunted him with the case containing the mushroom with the phone present in the room as she closed the door to make a copy of the signature page. Also, for a device so sophisticated, why did the headband receiver even need to be present as an intermediary between the laptop and the mushroom? 

&amp;#x200B;

However, I don't think any of this is was important.

&amp;#x200B;

**We are the deceived**

Playtest deliberately deceived us throughout the episode. Our standard methods of evaluating reality, like time and security cam footage, were clearly shown unreliable. Time flowed forward throughout the entire episode until the end, where it was identical with the time of uploading the software. But time is no longer valid as an objective metric given the frequency and precision of time visually and audibly reported in Cooper's altered reality. Security footage only occurred after the supposed crash, starting with the whack-a-mole game, and maintained throughout the haunted mansion. All of the horror/mystery/suspense genre clues we grew up relying on in entertainment only materialized from Cooper's altered state of mind. We are left with no options to judge what events actually transpired. Even the spoken Japanese is quite perplexing, as it is completely unnecessary to move the plot. The final scene had English subtitles, but all the pertinent information from that dialogue was entered in the crash report after Cooper was visually zipped up in a body bag. Trying to piece together what actually happened in the episode is akin to someone with Alzheimer's trying to piece together his/her own identity and/or the identities of those around them, only getting harder with the passage of time.

&amp;#x200B;

We followed Cooper in his own subjective hell. The mushroom was only able to make him feel physical pain where he had a strong association with it before. Strong associations in Cooper's brain were readily accessible areas for the software to exploit, with well connected neuronal avenues strengthened by fear rapidly escalated his nightmare, leading him to his perceived death as the primary function of fear is to circumvent mortality. Playtest took a guy who was relatively annoying and hard to connect with at the beginning to someone we can feel greater empathy with as we better understood his more subjective experiences in the latter 2/3s of the episode with modern cinematic tools that effective at invoking strong emotional responses for experiences we've never had.

I love the series, but I was disappointed by this episode.

First: if they knew it's going to be a bee to kill in that specific way, why don't you put the victim in a fully sealed chamber (like an hiperbaric chamber)? So long for the bees. Or simply cover the victim's head with a jacket: problem solved.  Even better: a beekeeper suit. Why use your hands to protect her ears? Are you f kidding me? (When the girl gets killed in the bathroom)

Second: it's a national security issue and you have a girl that knows ""the interwebz"", the guy that made it that seems he's lost for all the show (except when he activated the mass killings) instead of a team of professionist working on it. You literally have 3 people working on it, and none seems to be a network security professional (and anyway, you'd have a team working in every aspect of it)

Third: how hard would it be to inform twitter and ban the hashtag? Auto remove any message that uses it. Ban users, whatever instead of letting the guy play his game. They even were talking to ""shut down the internet NK style"". So a whole government can't have control over some tweets?

Forth: when all the bees start the killing there's the guy looking at the window waiting for the bees to get in and kill him. Dude, just put a fucking bucket and on your head, jump in a pool and you'll survive probably.

Fifth: instead of using explosives can't you use electricity to kill the bees? An EMP or something along those lines. Yeah, for sure in this future they didn't develop it yet.

I rewatched MEMEME! a while back and thought that it would actually make for a good episode of Black Mirror. Not the actual video, but a similar premise. I actually came up with one in my head.

A guy buys a new VR dating program for men. The program is similar to Second Life and Multiplayer RPGs, combined with the VR tech from USS Callister and White Christmas. Basically, the player lives in a virtual world via the eyes of an avatar with their virtual girlfriend (called Doe). Doe are extremely intelligent and advanced AI, not only looking 100% like real woman, but are designed to perfectly replicate human behavior, to the point of almost a step away from cookies. The only difference is that they don't feel negative emotions and are 100% loyal to their partner. The players can customize their Doe's apperance and personality. The protagonist designs his Doe as a highly sexualized version of a girlfriend he recently broke up with. Throughout the first act, we see how far he goes in making his Doe look, sound, and act like his ex.

Unfortuantely, the game is infected by a virus. Not a computer virus, but a sort of bio-tech virus that acts as an airborn plague in the VR world and turns the Does into overtly sexual vampiric creatures and locks the users' controls so they can't exit the game or contact the outside world. These mutated Doe act very much like the animated girls from MEMEME, constantly giggling and saying phrases like ""love you"" and ""together forever,"" with their apperance being overly sexualized, with big boobs and butts and giant eyes. They attack and cannibalize the users in order to feed off their brain activity, leaving the user braindead in the real world. When the episode starts, they are played by actual actresses, but after getting infected and morphing, they become more and more fake-looking, eventually turning into fully CGI characters, symbolizing their artificality. The rest of the episode is about the protagonists and another user trying to find a way to escape the game.

Themes of the episode include the dangers of virtual dating and artifical relationships, the objectification of women, the unrealisitic expectations and standards placed upon women in western culture, and the consuming nature of both dating games and VR games in general. 

Our protagonist is a grey character. On one hand, the episode makes us sympathize with me by showcasing just how deeply the breakup hurt him and how much he misses his ex, while at the same time showing us that HE was the cause of their breakup due to the unrealistic  standards he had for his ex. He wanted her to be something that she wasn't and when she refused, he left her. He is an introvert who wants to escape the harshness of reality with the dating game, only to find it literally trying to consume him.

&amp;#x200B;

I think White Bear is basically about how people's gluttony for excessive punishment can often be evil in itself. What Victoria and her boyfriend did was deplorable, but making her a zoo exhibit for people's justice boners is just as evil, if not moreso. 

15 Million Merits I think is a critique of modern capitalism, and a new take on the ""bread and circuses"" idea. People slave for money that doesn't bring them true freedom or happiness, and they are placated by the hope of becoming rich or famous.

San Junipero is a new take on the novel Tuck Everlasting (the name of the bar, Tucker's, and the company Tuckr I think is a clever reference to the book), but with the opposite message. In Tuck Everlasting Winnie chose to stay mortal instead of be immortal with Jesse after lots of consideration; in San Junipero Kelly chooses digital immortality with Yorkie, after a comparable amount of grappling. I think Charlie Booker is likely a transhumanist and views life extension positively, albeit with some reservations.

The Twilight series felt like a true mystery, there was a good portion happy endings, sad endings, mystery endings, and interpretation endings.

The concept for the show is great and exploration of future tech and how it affects people makes for an interesting show, but at this point I feel like its lacking more creativity.

Mind blowing acting by the entire cast, excellent direction and beautiful ladies (Adore Cristin Milioti &lt;3)! Also holy shit Jimmi Simpsons is a treasure.  

Most of you are already aware of the synopsis, so if you don't mind I just want to get philosophical about this episode and go on rambling. Can I? Thanks!  

I have thought about this a thousand times, even before the episode - Human Consciousness is just really complicated programing in a sense? Bioelectrical signals are like 1s and 0s in computer.  

What if one day we are able to easily produce AI which is just really complicated code? In literal sense - being able to create self aware and sentient life forms. I don't think it's impossible. Not only that but to simulate entire worlds. 

The thing is that we already have so much media where we can completely immerse ourselves or at least play God. It's just more toned down and everything isn't advanced enough to become sentient.  

Have you ever tried to create a character of your crush in SIMS and date them? Be honest, did you go on a torture spree when she rejected or friend zoned you? Did you ever summon your Bully and treat them like shit? How many times have you implemented your real life in fantasy? 

How many people do you think enjoy dating sims with anime girls who always fall for the player? How many times have you played a game which just makes you wish you were in there?    

Just imagine, your favourite fantasy universe. You're tired of life and what do you do? You transport your consciousness into a simulation and live a 1000 adventures in a perfect setting where you'll always find satisfaction, love and peace of mind.   

Its fucked up, if you were allowed to play God, how many people would abuse them? One day we reach a point where AI of NPCs are super advanced and sentient and they have to suffer the horrors you cause.  

But what if you don't be a sociopath. Will you still like going back to the real world after experiencing the perfect one? 

I know you may raise arguments like - I know it's not real, I don't want everything to be perfect, I want people who are realistic. 

But what if you were able to simulate this too? Just spice things a bit up compared to real life?

837,1540609343,9rr3yc,False,6,1,"To put 15MM in a timeline, I've narrowed it down to two theories.

&amp;#x200B;

1) The entire episode is a fictional movie or episode of TV show called 15 Million Merits and the characters in the episode are just actors. Therefore, 15 Million Merits would be an adaptation of the comic book Jack was reading in Black Museum, which would be very popular. In Crocodile, Mia was watching Wraith Babes, which is a real channel. She also referenced Hot Shot. So my theory is Hot Shot and Wraith Babes are both actual TV shows that are just referenced in the fictional franchise 15 Million Merits (TV shows are often referenced in other TV shows).  

&amp;#x200B;

2) My second theory is 15 Million Merits is also a TV show, but everyone there is a cookie, created for entertainment. Since cookies are unaware they are cookies, it would make sense. The bikes would give something for the cookies to do when bored. Again, Hot Shot and Wraith Babes would be referenced in the 15 Million Merits. 

&amp;#x200B;

So the main difference is in Theory 1, 15 Million Merits is a TV show, where the characters are all actors, whereas in Theory 2, 15 Million Merits is also a TV show, but instead of actors, the characters are cookies and the events that happen are real inside the cookie reality.

890,1540131104,9q3shn,False,8,1,"&gt;!Alright, so people have stated over and over that it's ""obvious"" that Kenny was indeed looking at CP.  
Except... I don't agree with this at all and think it's really faulty logic.  
&amp;nbsp;  
So here's my thought process on what's really happening and why Kenny was not looking at CP.  
1. Kenny is a normal kid. Completely normal in every way. Including the fact that he jerks off, to, probably, regular porn.  
The reason he's very cautious and embarassed about this is very simple: *Because he's a kid.* Bronn, like any adult, tells him outright: People masterbate. They just do that. Adults know. But when you're a kid, being caught jerking off is quite literally the end of the world. Nothing is worse. If that video got out, his social status would be ruined forever, even though his peers masterbate as well.  
He really is just trying to protect the video of him masterbating [to regular porn].  
&amp;nbsp;  
2. When Pedo Guy basically admits he himself a pedophile, he accuses Kenny of being just like him. This is a key point here: People assume by his silence and breaking down that Kenny is one. I think it's actually *because* he isn't one that he's so devastated and breaking down. Kenny is just a normal kid, that jerked off. Now he's mixed up with a would-be adulterer, and being forced to fight a pedophile to the death. As this means he must do the same as a pedophile, he's being treated as subhuman as a pedophile is. He's nowhere near as vile by society's standards, but he's being treated like one of the most vile types of people in existence (by society's standards). That's why he's breaking down: Because it's incredibly unfair. Few things are worse than being compared to a pedophile.  
As to why he was sent instead of Bronn, if not for a Pedo vs Pedo matchup? It could be as simple as the hackers believing that Bronn's age makes him ill-equipped for a fight, causing it to not be entertaining. Or there could have just been coincidence.  
&amp;nbsp;  
3. His silence and the recorded 'dialogue' between him and Pedo Guy was sent out. This *proved* that the guy was a Pedo to whomever (family/friends/etc). But most importantly, this doesn't *prove* Kenny is a pedophile. People often say, 'well his Mum said this' -- yeah, because like the viewer, his Mum saw that recording and *assumed* he was one because of his breaking down (for other reasons) and subsequent silence.  
As for the possibility of his Mum seeing CP as 'evidence'? Well, the hackers had access to Pedo Guy's computer, and they could have simply sent his stuff.  
&amp;nbsp;  
4. Opinion: It would be lazy writing. With all the crazy sex stuff out there, apart from trying to force a Pedo vs Pedo fight, it seems a bit ridiculous to have 2 of the 4 people seen being extorted as pedophiles when there are so many other options. What's more, while young pedophiles do exist, they are exceedingly rare. No one imagines a pedo as young. Now that may actually be the point: That pedos come in all shapes and sizes. But I feel this isn't enough of a twist, or that it's even creepy enough, for BM, especially given the nature of this episode.  
&amp;nbsp;  


As for Kenny asking, 'Why do I have to do it?' ... Yep, there isn't a point to this line other than to plant the seeds of doubt.  
And as for the kid at the beginning? ... Kenny really was just being a good kid. This is there so after the fact, you doubt that you're convinced he's a pedo.  
And if Kenny really weren't into CP, then why? Why did they try to get the least vile person of them all perform the worst actions of them all? No reason. No, really. No reason. *It's a troll.* It was for the lulz, just to prove we could.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Most everything presented is merely *suggestive:* It's all an attempt to make others assume he's a pedo; even the audience. That's my theory, anyway.!&lt;",True,blackmirror,"[Spoilers] Shut Up And Dance, and why I don't understand the leading theory about Kenny"

I just thought I would put my opinion here because I am not happy with anything forced. I don't want this to become a political debate but it eventually will, naturally. I am merely going to point out one thing I dislike about this and I am curious about your sound arguments. ""If you don't like it, don't watch it"" argument is one of those things that don't add any value to a discussion. Let's be civilized and have an insightful conversation. Here's hoping.

**WHAT'S MY PROBLEM**

I am an Eastern European so obviously, there are very rarely any interracial couples here. Psychologically speaking, so are anywhere in the world, as a person tends to stick to his own group (religion, ethnicity, even 'race'), intentionally or subconsciously. I don't mind interracial couples, after all love knows no race and I am fairly certain I could fall in love with an Arabic, Black or a Turkic woman, but what I see in this TV series is shoving interracial couples down the audience's throat. Please don't act angrily like I am a bigot or a racist or a xenophobe. I am pretty sure I am none of that, I respect everyone's existence, we are all human, people of any race can become a scientist or a president in our developed part of the world.  

It was fine when Michonne and Rick in TWD became a thing, Glenn and Maggie, it's all okay. While watching first episodes, I was like 'Alright, Channel 4 seems to be quite liberal. The UK is quite liberal as well, so it's okay. It's just one, two, three times it happened. Surely it won't be a rule.' And it pretty much became a rule. Even in Nosedive they had to portray it like that, in the holography. 

Certain episodes are way into the future, so obviously that'd be a good impression of the future, where not everyone/majority is white, especially in Western Europe. But I cannot actually name an episode where there was a couple of the same race. If things are natural, they're wonderful. Things like that happen, have happened and will happen. It's not dog-horse relationship, but a human-human relationship. However if things are forced, simply for the sake of being shown, then it loses its value. And it did for me. Then some ignorant people with a tendency to believe conspiracies start to think that the media are out to show people to racemix and 'destroy each other's race and finally destroy borders'. 

There is absolutely no added value with forced interracial couples quota. Overly liberal people will love it, people who want to enjoy the TV series without feeling some sort of ethnic/minority/multicultural politicization of TV series will either don't care or be annoyed by it. 

I watched the San Junipero episode and it was really interesting. At first I was bored, but the story alongside with the characters developing, it was actually refreshing, also to see bisexual/lesbian people being represented (which is important for you people, so you can feel not being alone), which to my surprise happened actually less frequently than interracial couples. It was refreshing and even more interesting because it wasn't some sort of a RULE that it would happen. I was glad actually that it did. 

That's the beauty of it, the beauty of rarity. You have something that occurs in real life. A rainbow? An albino raven? A perfect sunset? A thrilling violent storm? None of those things happen quite often/regularly, their beauty would be lost the moment you start seeing these phenomenons constantly/very regularly.

I love the idea that black mirror is a different dystopian future every episode, and it’s something new and fresh. And now I feel like the creators having fit everything into the same world is limiting. We’re never going to see another episode like 15 million merits because the events that take place in an episode like that don’t match up with the universe.

I know I'm late, but I have just watched Playtest. I searched through quite a few threads, but I couldn't find this mentioned. When we first see Cooper and Katie in the white room, there's a big clock on the wall, which says 5:34. Katie leaves the room at 5:35. Then Cooper gets up and takes a picture of the stuff in the box, and clearly, the time is 5:39 (or maaaybe 5:38, I couldn't make it out). *Then* Katie gets back, and it's 5:35 again. What's that about? I was thinking that maybe it was a mistake by the creators, but BM is too good to do something like that, and that clock was placed so deliberately there.

1050,1538998951,9me4ar,False,36,1,"I'm partway through a rewatch of the whole show, and it's struck me how many episodes revolve around cookies and other AI-based tech, particularly with the most reason season. 

Earlier on we had Be Right Back in season 2, then the White Christmas special and San Junipero in season 3. Season 4 really went for it though, with USS Callister, Hang the DJ and Black Museum - half the the entire season. 

It's worth noting that these are all great episodes in my opinion - some of my overall favourites from the entire show in fact.

AI is also an important sci-fi theme as it helps us explore important questions about our essential human natures, and what really makes us *us*. AI has also become increasingly relevant in the real world, even if most of what's out there is really machine learning puffed up with marketing hype. 

It's also probably quite tempting to revisit cookies in particular since the concept is well-established with viewers and can be done again with little introduction.

Those of us who live in the USA, doesn’t all of this remind you of the credit score? 
Yes this is not based on every interaction you have with everyone on a daily basis, it is limited to financial/government entities at least for now. The China system is an extension of what we already have in place in the US. 
Just like in Nosedive, your credit score can change many things in your life. If you have a bad score, you pay more for anything, get higher interest rate, also can be rejected on some rentals application and goes as far as getting denied a JOB. Just like in Nosedive, your score is far from an actual representation of your finances. Unless you constantly monitor it (for a monthly fee across all 3 credit bureaus) there are many people who can attest that there are often incorrect stuff out there, or some random stuff you never heard or were made aware of ending up in collection and ruining your score. Where i am from a medical company is well known for their billing department being incompetent and having sent people’s accounts to collection even though the payments were made. On the bigger spectrum if you have ever been victim of identity theft that could screw up your score as well. 
As an example, I went through my husband’s credit score reports a year before we bought our house in order to improve/fix it. I ended up finding that he had no less than 8 false creditor accounts from the tollway company of our state from a violation that had happened 5-6 years before that he was never notified about (he always updated his new adresses whenever he moved) which were making his score drop pretty badly. It took hours of phone calls and research to get it fixed. 
Same thing can be said in nosedive, some people have no legit cause from giving the main character a low rating in some moments, like for example when she was nice to that person in her office she ended up being downvoted for it.

   **Individuality in Nosedive**

The bright world described in “Nosedive”,“Black Mirror” by Charlie Brooker is one with dark undertones painted over crudely by pastel colors, smiles, and shrill, high-pitched, almost patronizing voices. The storyline followed a young woman named Lacie Pound on her conquest for increasing her social rating for the sake of gleaning a discount while buying an apartment. However, the butterfly effect went crazy on her and her quest. She got an invitation to her old friend’s wedding, but her booked plane was cancelled, she freaks out and gets penalized and demoted to three-out-of-five stars. She begins on a road trip to the wedding but her archaic car breaks down and she hitchhikes, then motorbikes, then arrives to Naomi’s dislike.

There was a recurring theme that was woven throughout Nosedive that created an eerie tension for oneself. It was the crushing of intellectual diversity into ash and the incineration of honesty and truth. When an oppressive ranking system is incorporated into a sociable and varied group, disastrous things are bound to happen, as they did in Nosedive. 

It is in our nature to socialise, to fit in. Usually, the best first choice is to follow the majority, the *wisdom of the crowd*. “We all like others who are similar to us,” Psychologist Daniel Haun explains. If you look carefully at the phones and tablets in Nosedive, you see that they were all the same build, brand, and color. This is an example of the phenomenon that is conformity. After one person buys a tablet of the brand and more people follow suit, you reach a tipping point in which everyone has that particular brand of device. Not only were their devices the same, their clothes, hair, and houses were the same. Pastel, tailored, ship-shape. When Lacie Pound begins stretching in a park, her eyes still glued to her phone, the camera pans out and you get a glimpse of her neighborhood. Rows upon rows of colorful, identical, seemingly perfect townhouses. This scale of assimilation is possible in Nosedive because it is necessary for them to socialise and fit in because if they don’t, they slip down the social rankings and “it’s buh-bye!” for them. 

The presence of individuality (or lack thereof) in Nosedive is startling. Every inch of every acre is uniform and ordered. Expected and identical. This describes the essence of the citizens and the society described in Nosedive. It’s a community aimed at making people comfortable, on the surface at least. When Lacie begins her jog, strangers chirp a pleasant greeting at her, and she echoed said greeting. In Nosedive, no one starts anything new, and they certainly don’t dare to even imply something disturbing. Once you “start saying what (you) want, when (you) wanted,” Susan confessed, “people don’t always like that.” The sickening thing is that citizens “didn’t care for honesty” and accepted this. In a normal world, you try to better yourself to glean benefits. In Nosedive-dystopia-town, you tried to moderate yourself, god forbid you be slightly offensive. And if you’re successful in your endeavors of silencing your opinion and droning in unison with the crowd, your rank climbed upwards. The clothes of the slaves to the ranking programs were pastel uniforms. Their homes were orderly “fake-smile jail cells,” and their mannerisms were expected and identical, forced on by pure social pressure.

The sameness coupled with the societal constraint on any disturbance that changes said sameness for the sake of the citizens fragile sense of comfort stagnates any effort to create a different personality or to be yourself. There is no chance to further your individualism. Because of this, females were unnaturally gentle, insincerely caring, saccharine-sweet husks while males were acting bold, with a phony facade of being macho macho. Albeit the biological build of men and women do see a strong relationship with traditional gender roles, it’s taken too far in Nosedive. Dozens of phone give approving beep-beep-beeps in unison after Naomi’s new husband yells “Get over here! Get your a\*\* over here!” to his friend, “You f\*\*\*ing earned it, man. You f\*\*\*ing earned it!” Lacie used the same language in the airport terminal and look at where it landed her- outlawed. Another flaw attributed to the lack of individualism is the lack of character development throughout their life. Take Bethany, an age-worn grandma who had the persona and pitch of a teenager. You know the scope of someone’s conversation skills were sad when you respond to “Well, maybe not forever,” with “No, not forever” and echoed “It's OK for now” to “It’s great for now.” The rest of the “conversation” was filled in with shrill giggling and strained smiles from the two conversing parties.

This order was hard worked for and was well achieved. However, it created a mass of sheepish sycophants who were oversensitive babies with the personality of a fourteen year old. It isn’t healthy nor is it liberating and after a while, it certainly is not comfortable. The great takeaway from Nosedive is that being social is nice, but keeping a hold of your identity and your common sense is needed. For as soon as you strip the crudely painted pastel colors, you expose a dystopia built for the destruction of  our unique human spirit.

People are trying to humanize or rationalize the decisions she made claiming she could have made better choices than what lead to her arrest. It's sort of similar to how people react to mass shootings or deadly crimes in that we try to understand the motives behind the why but can never fully grasp or comprehend the answer. The truth is, none of us rational human beings could come remotely close to understanding the raw complex emotions of a sociopath and we justify the insane behavior by joking about or discussing it. We underestimate the lengths that these types of people are willing to take to stay ahead of the curve. None of us would ever cross the line like that sure, but many of us have never been pushed to that same line either. Let's take a short review of the events that happened.

1. 15 years after the initial traumatic crime, Rob comes back into her life for a meeting. Her reaction upon learning his decision to confess is to get angry, ""I fucking sat on this for you"".

She buried this lie deep and bottled up any type of emotions of remorse for 15 years. She tried throwing herself into her work and had much success in doing so and even started a family to which she was the major provider. Her ego allowed her to get a swelled head and arrogantly begin to make her think she was finally in control of her life but this was the meager beginnings trickling into narcissistic behavior. There was a switch that flipped in her which increased this innate desire for being in control of all things that could happen in her life so as to avoid another tragedy, even at the cost of those who are innocent. This initial meeting has a rolling snowball effect which hurls her choices down a hill to make worse and worse decisions just to cover up a single lie that she held over the years. Yes, she didn't commit the crime but now she knew she would be guilty and lose all that she had worked so hard to achieve. 

2. She attempts to manipulate the results of her meeting with Shazia. When she realizes she has been unsuccessful, she tries to poorly sweet talk her way out of Shazia leaving with what she saw and when that is unsuccessful her next reaction is brash anger at her inability to handle the situation. 

We often underestimate the precious value we place on control of our lives. Whether it be how much we eat, how much we play, or how much we love, or what we value. There are lengths we as humans would go to to ensure our ideal quality of life does not get disturbed by another human being. When that control is disrupted it causes a break in our psyche and the meager house of safety we had built comes crashing down to dust. 

3. Mia despicably slaughters Shazias husband and infant son. 

As depicted in the previous season 3 of Black Mirror (Shut Up and Dance), people who have committed shameful crimes will go to great lengths to cover up something they did in the past. Have you ever tried falling asleep at night and then your brain remembers something stupid or trivial you said in the third grade that was embarrassing and you would do anything to forget it and just fall asleep? This is that feeling intensified a hundred times over for Mia. She once again is frustrated at the fact she couldn't handle the situation the way she wanted (quietly), as her ring-tone blares right before killing Shazia's husband and alerts him to an intruder. 

She comes to the sobering fact that she threw away her humanity and still was unsuccessful in hiding her crimes. She cries not because she feels remorse, but because she was caught.

Was Mia wronged by Rob? Absolutely not. Had she come forward 15 years ago she probably would have been let off the hook after an investigation. But because she chose to stay silent, she accepted the fact that it happened and truly believed she could get away with it. That's what makes her a narcissist, a sociopath, and a crocodile.

It caused society to realize how codependent their lives were on technology. Finance, transportation, communication - everything wrapped around code, and if it was to fail, we're fucked. Although, for whatever reason, our dependence on technology grows and grows. 

Black mirror tells a story that if we keep building up this reliance on technology, that our lives can go to shit. Episodes like Shut Up and Dance or Hated in The Nation Show this the most. Character(s) subject to hacking, targeted because of it. Then there's episodes like Playtest where a programs bug literally killed the main character.

1152,1538099703,9jiwe0,False,70,970,"Last summer my girlfriend went on a 2 month trip in Europe. About a month into her trip I started getting an uneasy feeling like something was happening over there - like she wasn't faithful. I don't know what planted that seed. I can't remember why I felt this way or how I came to that feeling. We had been in a committed relationship for 3 years and I had never experienced jealousy or relationship insecurity once. But something just felt... off. The ensuing anxiety and inability to feel reassured by her due to our distance drove me crazy. My behaviour became more and more erratic. 

&amp;#x200B;

I started monitoring her social media activity. If I texted her I would check to see how long it took for her to reply, knowing that she was on her phone all the time. I would monitor her ""last time on facebook"" activity, and her instagram likes and story posts. When she'd text me back hours later and say she hadn't been on her phone/ there was a poor connection I knew she was lying. This would consume me with rage/fear/insecurity. I would oscillate between being convinced she was unfaithful to feeling like I was acting crazy and sabotaging my amazing relationship because I was insecure. I must an anxiety disorder, I thought. This was torture. Absolute and complete torture. I hope none of you ever experience the way I felt.

&amp;#x200B;

During this time, I started watching Black Mirror. Netflix is an easy distraction when things aren't going well in life. But black mirror was far from an easy distraction. Each episode was challenging in its own way. I've never felt so entertained and exhausted by anything in my whole life. Then I put on The Entire History of You.

&amp;#x200B;

The first 5 times I watched it I couldn't make it past the dinner party scene in the first act. I would start panicking every time I tried to watch it. It captured how I felt perfectly. We both had a beautiful, sweet and intelligent girl who loved us and without evidence - just an inexplicable gut feeling - we felt like something wasn't right. It was hitting too close to home and I gave up on this episode.

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend came home. She repeatedly denied anything had happened with anyone. That she always has and always will be faithful. We came to an understanding and I was able to emotionally limp along for the next year. Things went mostly back to normal but about once a month I would become convinced something wasn't right again. The smallest details set me off. I'd see a text from a guy friend from Europe that she never spoke about. I noticed her becoming highly protective of her phone. I noticed that was no longer in any of her social media stories. Was she hiding something or was this a response to me acting suspicious about her? She would become furious any time I alluded to this - a plausible response if she were either innocent or guilty. I was in over my head.

&amp;#x200B;

About 3 months ago I was finally able to finish the Entire History of You. We all know what happens. It's completely devastating. I was holding back tears and my heart was thundering. His life. His emotions. His behaviour. **It was me.** I hated what I saw and it made me physically sick. This was my fucking life. 

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short - I eventually broke into her phone. Translated texts (she was fluent in the language of the country she visited) from a guy I was suspicious about. Sussed out that they were flirting. She denied anything happened but that she agreed that she was ""toeing the line"". I demanded to see all her messages or I'd break up with her right then and there. She agreed. I translated more. Sussed out that they had been fucking him behind my back for a month, carrying on a long distance relationship, and that she was planning on seeing him again this summer after spending time with me in Europe.  

&amp;#x200B;

I immediately broke up with her, wished her the best and removed any evidence of her from life. Blocked her phone and and social media and haven't contacted her since. 2.5 months have gone by. I haven't felt this good in more than year. Not a hint of anxiety since the immediate aftermath of our breakup.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason why I'm writing this mess of a long post about my personal life on this board is because I wanted to say that no other piece of art or media has affected me in the way that this episode has. And isn't that what art is supposed to do - to challenge you to think and feel? I don't like this episode of Black Mirror. In fact I hate it. But it by that definition this episode is the greatest piece of art I've ever experienced. Sorry for getting carried away.

&amp;#x200B;

I know you're all judging me right now. I'm judging me too. I'm not proud of my behaviour. But being in love with someone who you don't trust will disassemble who are bit by bit - especially, if at the same time, you don't trust yourself. I've learned so much and will never let this happen to me again. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR;**

**I had also been suspicious of my long term girlfriend of cheating on me while I watched The Entire History Of You. The episode was too devastating to watch. Pursued and discovered my ex had been cheating on me just like on Black Mirror. Came to the realization that no other piece art affects me like this episode does.**

I watched it (it was really interesting, i really liked it), but I wanted to try and find a version of it possibly without music and with the original audio. I tried searching for it, and then the Youtube app crashed. I went back on to the app and tried searching for it again, and it crashed again (the screen just goes black when it crashes). This continued for maybe a total of 4 or 5 times. I decided to test it and decided to search for something completely unrelated, and it worked fine with no problems whatsoever.

Best actor : Toby Kebbel in a Entire History of You. Flawless and magnetic performance.

Best actress : Gugu Mbatha-Raw in San Junipero. Especially that moment when she talks about her husband and daughter. Her face and tone changes, and she actually speaks like an older person.

Best director : Euros Lyn for 15 million merits. The pace, the visuals, the song, the speech. Actors directing. A masterpiece.

To me this completely changed how I thought of 15MM. To me you it seems like going to that facility is a choice you make when you turn 21 but that makes me ask Where were they before, what were they doing before, were they just at different part of the facility, why would you want to go there, why don't you talk about your time pre 21. Also she says she wanted to go to ""air down"" as opposed to biking so that means that there are many other jobs at the facility we don't know about, I am not sure if air down is full because it requires getting passed hot shot and is like full like they were with the singers or not but it could also be another menial labour job.

I only started watching a couple episodes of Black mirror last night. I did choose to watch this one because it had been mentionned regularly regarding another show i am watching, my favorite show actually “Westworld”.
Now i totally understand the references regarding white christmas and the second season of Westworld.

I came here regarding a different topic than the debate of sentient AI, but i had a theory about Beth.
Has anyone thought that her behavior could have been due to the fact that until the birth she did not know who was the real father? I mean we don’t know if there was any technology available to be able to know the father without DNA test after birth so maybe Beth was holding the block until she found out who was the father and had joe been the father she would have unblocked him and made up a story about her reaction without ever revealing the affair. I know even in our world there are ways to find out paternity of foetus but this involves a risky procedure that many people would rather avoid. 

I read a few posts about that episode and i never saw any mention about the fact that her behavior which seem irrational could have had a different explanation (why not just telling him? Abortion or taking the risk that joe never finds out about affair if the child turns out to be his?)

It was the first episode I watched that felt Hollow and didn't have any meaning to it besides trying to shock whoever's watching.

1376,1536336079,9dvq83,False,4,16,"Over 6 years ago while I was still a teenager, a girl I was dating for several years cheated on me with several guys. The only reason I found out was by realizing there were holes in her stories and piecing things together slowly over the course of several months, before forcing her to show me her phone where she had videos of her having sex with several other guys in plain sight. 

I developed some pretty severe trust issues and didn't have a single relationship for several years as a result of this ordeal. 

Fast forward 6+ years, I'm long over my trust issues and I'm in a loving 3 year relationship, looking to propose soon. About a year ago we took a short break in our relationship where I ended things while I was going through depression. We got back together shortly after and things have been as great as ever. 

I watched The Entire History of You for the first time and it was the first BM episode that had a profound impact on me. I watched it two more times that same night. I empathized incredibly with how Liam overanalyzed and replayed things, both in his professional and personal life. 

Suddenly, all of those trust issues I thought were gone years ago came rushing back. For the first time in my relationship with my girlfriend, I started thinking about irregularities in our relationship. One thing I noticed was that she had started snapchatting/texting a male childhood friend of her's a lot more recently. I knew they had known each other forever, but I found it odd that she was talking/texting him so much and that she never mentioned him to me. 

A few weekends ago, she went on a camping trip with her group of childhood friends. She mentioned names of who she was going with, but his never came up, which raised some red flags in my head. 

While she was gone, I began overthinking things and started thinking the worst, much like Liam in the episode, that she might be cheating on me with this friend of her's. 

When she got back from her trip, I was pretty much a mental mess from overthinking and broke down. I told her how I noticed her talking to this friend of her's more and how she never brought up his name. I asked her what was up and asked to see her phone. 

Quickly enough, she broke down and told me she started sex with him while we were broken up but stopped talking before we got back together. Her texts with him proved as much. However, the weekend she was gone on her trip, she messaged him while drunk telling him he should ""come up and hang out with the rest of us"". She also Snapchat him more than anybody else she was friends with. This seemed incredibly disingenuous and I called her out on it. She was very heartfelt in telling me that their relationship has been purely platonic and the only time she texted him was when she was in a group setting with other friends, and how she would never do anything to bring down our relationship. I'm inclined to believe her since they've never texted since. 

I realize my girlfriend really did nothing wrong. Sometimes I wish I had never bothered asking anything at all. So now I'm pursuing therapy for my extreme trust issues. She doesn't say it, but I know my girlfriend thinks I'm broken and walks on eggshells when it comes to showing me her phone or hanging out with her friends. We're no longer as intimate and conversations about us being life long partners have slowly come to a stop. I noticed she deleted her friend off her Snapchat and her contacts, which makes me think I might've damaged something there too.

1.) When she is looking at the dust motes in the air in her jail cell. I’m wondering if this has to do with her contacts being removed. When we see the world before their removal the whole world has this bright, filter quality to it. Like we are constantly seeing the world through an Instagram filter and it’s making what we see seem more beautiful than it really is. Even the more ugly places are still more beautiful than what would seem “normal.” Then they remove her contacts and it feels like that “filter” is removed and the world is darker and more gritty. She notices the dust motes in the air. The imperfections. 

2.) If Black Mirror is all in the same universe, than I’m wondering if Nosedive would take place after Hated in the Nation. This is because such a mass killing took place because of violence between the way people spoke to each other and the things they wrote online. Because of the cyber bullying and the mean mob mentality of people. They banned profanity. They developed a system to where you could no longer hide behind you internet profile. People had learned that the things you said and did, on the internet especially, had consequences. So society turned everything into “nice” and “polite.” They made it so that the nicer and more polite you were the more people liked you. In a way it was like society had learned from their mistake in Hated in the Nation.  But they took it to far, as society  normally does. Like they took the internet bullying too far.

1406,1536089353,9cyvrs,False,13,90,"I was watching a video from Screenprism (Totally recommend it btw) about the shared universe in Black Mirror right after I'd watched another video from the channel about the cookies or digital copies that are constantly brought back to us on the show and it suddenly hit me.

I'm one of those fans who believe that every Black Mirror episode happens in the same universe, the same world and I've seen dozens of timelines here on reddit and on other websites that try to make a consistent timeline based on references to one episode in another or the technological advances in each of them. But one episode that to me never seemed to fit anywhere is **Fifteen Million Merits.**

I'm gonna go ahead and assume that since you're still reading this you've already watched the episode, as well as probably the rest of the show. The whole thing about those people living in that place that seemed so far from everything we've seen before. How that's totally disconnected from reality while other Black Mirror episodes always bring elements that remind us of our own society while including a little or a lot more of technology. All of this combined with the fact that the talent show featured in Fifteen Million Merits is presented to us on a ad in The Waldo Moment.

All of that led me to believe that the people in Fifteen Million Merits are actually **Cookies living in a virtual reality**.

That would explain not only why that reality happens simultaneously to the events in The Waldo Moment but also why those characters' lives are so empty and why they live that why. We could even guess the reasons why people would willingly (or unwillingly maybe) create those cookies of themselves and place them in that reality:

# 1- To generate energy 

We see in the episode that the people live in Fifteen Million Merits have two purposes: finding their talent and achieving fame (which we'll talk about later) and generating energy, and their reward consists on winning credits that they can spend on food, submit to talent shows and watching the programs they're constantly presented with through ads (which we'll also talk about later). But what if they're providing energy not just so that system can exist but also to real life?

It is proven to us in White Christmas that cookies can alter reality and in Black Mirror making them work all day to provide energy to real people would be more than normal

&amp;#x200B;

[Cookie working so that her real persona's house is ideal](https://i.redd.it/g6lbfwutv9k11.jpg)

# 2- To entertain people in the real world

Another totally possible scenario considering it's Black Mirror. Their main purpose and motivation in life is to appear and watch those talk shows (to serve as a wii character inspired audience), so they would possibly be much more hard-working annd probably even talented than their real life personas. Also that would allow the judges (who I suspect live in the real world and only go there to be part of the show like Matt Trent in White Christmas) to treat them however they'd wish, since cookies don't seem to have any rights by this time of the Black Mirror timeline.

But perhaps the biggest prove of this is that billboard I mentioned that appears in The Waldo Moment

&amp;#x200B;

[Billboard featuring Abi Khan from Fifteen Million Merits in The Waldo Moment](https://i.redd.it/0nbs05gzv9k11.jpg)

# 3- So that the people who upload their cookies to that world know if they actually have talent and could ever have a chance in that competitive talent show reality

This reason would only be possible if people willingly uploaded another version of themselves into that system.

That would explain why we see the same actress(Hannah John-Kamen) who plays Selma in Fifteen Million Merits living a totally different life as Sonja in Playtest.

If this is true, it would mean that the cookies in Fifteen Million Merits had their memories altered to believe they have different names and that that society is normal, much like they did in White Christmas and Hang The DJ. That would also explain why we only see adults in the episode. Because this software is probably for adults who would like to see if they have some talent without actually facing rejection and fighting for it. Not only this, but it would explain (I realize I've said this a hundred times by now. But this is a theory after all, I need to support my arguments) why the characters all need to constantly watch ads during their working and resting hours. Because it's probably a free software but their virtual version have to watch ads unless they win credits to skip them.

&amp;#x200B;

I realize this theory doesn't theory doesn't affect the episode that much, since cookies are still people and the whole satire and discussion brought by the episode is still up. But at least to me this offers a huge satisfaction as it finally grants Fifteen Million Merits some sense. Not only it fits the timeline as happening virtually simultaneously to The Waldo Moment and possibly the episodes that come after it but it explains why the world in the episode feels so unreal and distant from our reality, kind of life Joe's Cabin in White Christmas (which he couldn't even remember at the beginning, proving that Cookies memories can be altered) or the entire virtual world presented in Hang The DJ. Whose app, I would suggest, could have been inspired by the system in Fifteen Million Merits, after the developers realized that people who had never seen each other before in real life could fall in love inside the program and decided to create a whole dating social media with that premisse.

You can find arguments for or against almost any point of view, and since filter bubbles are a thing, you'll most likely never see that there are valid arguments for opposing views as well. SEO will have a major impact in future elections if it hasn't already. There are topics with no defined answer, like country borders that aren't solved yet.

The show has enough variety that I’ve found I can pick a taster episode based on the individual (USS Callister for my Star Trek-loving dad, San Junipero for my wife who doesn’t like things too bleak, etc)

Now I actually like National Anthem. I think it raises some interesting questions about our media consumption, and also has a lot of funny and tense moments by turns. Plus, I really like Rory Kinnear and enjoyed him as the PM.

However, the use of pig fucking as the overarching plot device really overshadows everything else. It’s so deeply crude and out there that it dilutes any message the episode is trying to deliver and it turns into the same kind of gross-out, car-crash spectacle it’s trying to call out.

It’s also a weird choice of first episode because the speculative futurism and dystopian sci-fi elements that are the show’s hallmarks are pretty much absent. Almost every other episode is hinged around advancing technology and the resulting social shifts and the only other one I can think of that exists entirely in the here and now is Shut Up and Dance. 

However, I personally find that to be one of the most powerful and affecting episodes, in part \*because\* it is entirely feasible right now. While National Anthem \*could\* happen right now, the whole premise is too ridiculous for that to take root and have anything like the same impact.

Anyone else experience National Anthem directly putting people off of the show? I can only imagine how many people caught it on TV back in the day or randomly chose it on Netflix and then noped out. Maybe it’s for the best that Netflix suggests the new seasons first.",True,blackmirror,‘National Anthem’ is a bad first episode and probably costs this show a lot of viewers

So far as I can tell, it's been bought by Netflix and Americanized, and I have very mixed feelings about it. On the one hand, the idea behind the episode, the acting and production and everything were great, but the presentation of the story made it completely predictable. Nothing was kept hidden from the viewer, nothing was a mystery at any point; the viewer is never in the dark about what's going on. Everything was explained very clearly so that you're not only keeping pace with what's happening, but if you've got a working head on your shoulders, you're several steps ahead twiddling your thumbs, waiting for the show to catch up and be over.

On the whole, I hated it.

1492,1535462095,9ayta9,False,6,11,"I'm going to provide my take on the three main character of the episode. Also, this contains major spoilers.

""Good"" and ""bad"": It was Rob's idea to hide the body, out of a selfish reason. Why did Mia give in to Rob's demand? Maybe, She was too shocked and devestated and just let Rob decide on her behalf. Also, she might have done an illegal and unethical thing in order to protect a loved one.

Now, fifteen years after the incident, Mia had a lot to lose, Rob didn't. Of course, it might be argued that Rob just couldn't pull his life together because of the guilt, while Mia just had found a way to move on despite an unclear conscience. This also has something to do with the sunk cost fallacy. They both paid heavily in an emotional way for hiding the incident; Mia was able to create a descent life despite of the pain, while Rob couldn't. Now, in Mia's mind all the pain and inner conflict she had experienced while building her life would have been in vain if the beans had been spilled. But Rob hadn't gained much for hiding his pain, so it was way easier for him to put himself in risk by writing a letter.

All that being said, the Rob's decision to write a letter was the right and the ethical choice, and Mia's decision to give in to Rob's demand to hide the body was a wrong decision. One of the most emotionally devastating lines for me and in this regard was the final sentence of the last song: ""You know you gonna be remembered for the things you say and do"". 

As a final note on Mia, while it's extremely difficult for me to *empathize* with her considering all the things she did, I can definitely *sympathize* with her (As I can with all the other ""evil"" characters in the series).

Now about the ""ugly"" character: It was Shazia. It became very hard for us to criticize her after the horrifying things that happened to her and her family, but she should be criticized. Of course, she was doing her job and she had the law on her side. Not only that, the law forced people to cooperate with her. But it doesn't change the fact that what she had been doing was highly unethical. She made a living out of intruding people privacy, and harming them emotionally. To make it worse, she seemed to have a very clear conscience despite of that.

**\*THIS THREAD SHOULD LEAD TO OPEN DISCUSSION, I DON'T WANT MY VIEWS EXPRESSED HERE TO BE TAKEN AS DEFINITIVE, AND WOULD LOVE MULTIPLE OTHER OUTLOOKS\***

  


That being said, during a close friend's 18th birthday party, several of us decided to dive into the cryptic, and dark world of Black Mirror. Shortly after, we experienced heartbreak, death, political and emotional deception, and terrorism. And while we didn't fall into a VR simulation screaming ""MOM!"" from the top of our lungs, we did engage in discussion about what we'd seen.

The most interesting (imo) of which, revolved around Season 3 Episode 3, *Shut Up and Dance*.

Mainly, who to root for? In previous episodes like *USS Callister* or *Fifteen Million Merits*, our main hero(s) were established from the get-go, without much deviation as the episode went on. Obviously Kenny of *SU&amp;D* begins as our protagonist, but is that term symbolic with ""hero""? 

As the episode comes to a close and we discover the true nature of his crimes, pedophilia. Kenny starts to warp far across the line of an Anti-Hero, becomes something of a villain, when compared to our local and luxurious couch-based lifestyle. But what about that is so enjoyable? I think because that wasn't the first episode of Black Mirror I'd seen, I was OK with the ending, but at the end of the day it still seems sort of... lackluster.

A character we'd sympathized with for the entire season, turned into someone we couldn't root for anymore. **Kenny turned into a bad person**. We as an audience are then faced with a question; who's side are we on now? Do we still hope Kenny makes it out, and if so does that make us morally gray, as to root for a pedophile? Or do we abandon the main character completely and by doing so, our investment in the episode? So my open-ended questions can be stated as such:  


1.) Were you disappointed with this ending/how Kenny ended up?

2.) What about a protagonist makes us want to root for them, and were those characteristics stripped from Kenny at the end of the episode?

3.) Is Kenny still the ""hero"" of the story? Or had his character turned into an Anti-Hero, or even Villain?

   Rolo and Norton were both extremely dangerous and immoral characters, who had one thing in common: They were both law-abiding people. Nish and Poirot went on to stop them in the only possible way which was taking justice into their own hands and executing them. But there were very important differences between Nish and Poirot. 

   Nish did it in a very self-righteous way, while Poirot didn't (Poirot actually punished himself by not taking his medicine and dying as a result). Also, Nish went on and pulled the lever and also trapped a digital clone of Rolo in a device in an unending cycle of pain. I really cannot put her morally on top of those people who executed the digital clone of his father over and over again. But Poirot actually ran a ""trial"" and sentenced Norton to death, and let him know about it. He didn't torture Norton and executed him in his sleep by putting a bullet into his head. Poirot just felt obliged to stop Norton, because the law couldn't do that, nothing more.

1533,1535184217,9a58ua,False,7,8,"I think the best word I can think to sum up my feelings after watching this episode is ???

Perhaps it's just mangled expectations, but when the guy started going into the different narratives and such, along with the fact that it was a museum showing hints of things from past episodes, I got the impression that they were going to explain where certain Black Mirror tech came from (or at least, the internal logic evolution of it). Not necessarily 100%, but to some reasonable degree that would help shape the structure of the Black Mirror universe.

But ultimately, I left feeling more confused about the Black Mirror universe than before. It ended up feeling like the nuggets in the museum referencing other episodes were just fan service, not something with any actual internal logic in the story.

For example, the lolipop on the dish that was presumably referencing USS Callister. This raises so many impossible to answer questions if it's supposed to follow internal Black Mirror universe logic.

Is this supposed to imply that Daly was using a variation on tech developed by the people who Rolo Haynes was working with? Or was Daly one of the people developing the tech in the first place? How could Haynes have possibly gotten ahold of it at all? Are we to presume that the story of what happened with Daly somehow got out and Haynes somehow got access to the dish, despite having no apparent connection to the incident?

I don't want to dwell too much on that one point though. 

Other things that left me feeling more confused: I believe it's imply or stated that cookies came about as a result of the ""can experience thing that other person is feeling"" tech, but it's still not explained why we should give a shit about what happens to cookies other than the fact that they are copies of a human consciousness and therefore could have self-awareness, even though they probably don't since they can be deleted, paused, etc., so easily. I don't know if this is left ambiguous on purpose, or if we are just supposed to go along with the weak sci-fi (stuff like references to how much of our brain we use and another consciousness taking up space.. what?? I expected better from a show like Black Mirror).

Some other references made... St. Juniper (presumably related to San Junipero - a cool connection, but not explored at all).

A world where torturing someone or something is considered entertaining and sporty, considering the crowd Haynes had at one point (fits with the people going along with White Bear), but yet, no explanation as to where this cultural evolution comes from. Is it just presumed that this is how people in RL are? How does this exist in the same universe where cookies have rights? The juxtaposition makes very little sense to me.

And then it's stopped because of some protests? 

This just felt sort of like White Christmas, but with more questions than answers at the end and no clear connection between them. Multiple narratives, not necessarily related, just an apparent halfway explanation of how certain tech came to be. Spends way too much time on each story and barely explains anything about the tech. And at the end, Nish is only connected to one of the stories and none of the others have any meaningful relevancy, other than being filler for showing the evolution of tech, but not in a way that really explains anything conclusively.

Is this just me having mangled expectations? Why does this episode feel like such a mess?

I feel like it had some really solid moments and build-up, but it doesn't get tied together well at all. I also didn't really feel much sympathy for Nish. The reveal was too abrupt and the fact that she was so vindictive about it didn't help. I'm not sure if she was supposed to be a sympathetic character or not. Maybe the point was that she was as twisted as Haynes was.

1557,1535028708,99n42n,False,5,30,"I have seen a few timelines proposed on this sub for the sequential order of episodes of Black Mirror. This is difficult to do as the technology featured does not seem to have an obvious continuity, and the Black Mirror universe uses subtle Easter eggs rather than overarching plots to tie in episodes with one another. 

With that said, here is my timeline, along with some analyses on what is going on in the world at the time. Rather than attempt to number every episode, I have decided to group episodes into eras. The order of episodes which share an era will not always be definitive. This timeline also relies on some non-canon extrapolation, but to the best of my knowledge, my timeline does not contradict any established canon. 


**The Modern Era**

This era is characterized by present day tech.

1) *The National Anthem*
    *Shut up and Dance*

2) *The Waldo Moment*

These three episodes do not rely on hypothetical future technology. The only problem Waldo presents for the timeline is the ending, that Jaime wakes up in a seemingly dystopian future. Jaime does not appear to have aged much, so we can assume it is only a few years later. 

I theorize that Waldo was a passing fad. While many powerful people did exploit it, I think that they were not successful in the long term as using Waldo as a means of population control. The city in the ending scene certainly looks futuristic, but ultimately we don't see anything more than armored police and a lot of screens. Perhaps this time was a brief period of unrest, but society resumed looking relatively normal shortly after. 


**The Postmodern Era**

This era is characterized by near future tech.

3) *Playtest*
    *White Bear*

These two episodes show near future tech. White Bear is nearly possible in the real world now, assuming we could perfect a technique for inducing the desired amount of retrograde amnesia required to continually make Victoria accept the fiction. 

In Playtest, Cooper dies in the moment he tests the gopher game, so the tech did not necessarily have to be advance enough for the horror game Cooper played, which was a time dilated experience Cooper had in his own head as all his ""synapses lit up all at once."" 
Tech required for a virtual reality uploaded to someone's brain may be far off in the real world, but it seems closer than the tech featured in all other episodes. 

4) *Hated in the Nation*

It is interesting to note that in this episode, the UK has a Chancellor rather than a Prime Minister. This could be indicative of a political shift that started in the Waldo era, or it might be what came after the Waldo era once the UK became stable again after whatever unrest in Waldo caused armored police to prowl the street. However, the UK may still be a relatively normal democracy at this point: Chancellor and Prime Minister are comparable positions with different names.


**The Augmentation Era**

This era is characterized by early transhumanism and a comprehensive understanding of the human brain which allows for the tech featured.

5) *Crocodile*

This episodes features the most primitive tech of the era.

6) *Arkangel* 

This is a precursor to the more advanced grain tech in The Entire History of You.

7) *Be Right Back*

Be Right Back is one of the most difficult episodes to place, as it requires very advanced robotics technology, but it certainly predates sentient cookies and simulation tech. I believe this episode fits within the Augmentation Era, but I'm not sure where. But because of how realistic and dynamic Ash, I have decided this happens right before the UK embraces grains.

8) *The Entire History of You*

This is the peak of the augmentation era. This happens at least several decades after Krokodil and Arkangel, as there are children who have had grains long enough that they are using them to sue their parents for insufficient attention. I also am going to make two guesses: One, that many people do not have grains (they are not mandatory and all the people featured in The Entire History of You are upper-middle class, they might not be available to poorer people. Two, grains were eventually done away with. And from here we enter: 


**The Simulation Era**

I have chosen to place this era here and use it to categorize two episodes which are very difficult to place on the timeline.

9)  *Hang the DJ*
    *15 Million Merits*

The placement of 15 Million Merits here is probably going to be the most controversial thing on this timeline, because I am contending that 15 Million Merits was a simulation. Two reasons for this: One, in Black Museum, 15 million merits is a story that is read in a graphic novel which shows Bing with the shard of glass at his throat. Two, it’s just an absurd world, and in my opinion, too absurd to be real. The use of the bicycles implies not only an energy crisis but that humans despite advancement have not only run out of fossil fuels but are no longer able to exploit solar, wind, nuclear or any other kind of power. And yet for the primitive technique of creating energy by pedaling, screens are everywhere, sucking up a lot of this supposedly vital energy that everyone pedals so hard for. What the purpose of this stimulation was is unknown. If you disagree with the simulation theory and think 15 Million Merits is real, then it’s the furthest into the future.

I am placing Hang the DJ before all cookie featuring episodes, and the reason for this is the assumption  that the sims are not actually sentient. As they lose time and can’t remember where they were before, I think that the actual length of the episode, around 50 minutes, it actually the length of a “lifetime” in the sim and that nothing we didn’t see actually happened to the sims. These two episodes are by far the most difficult to place, since placing them relies on several assumptions. 


**The Cookie Era**

This era is characterized by the creation of sentient cookies.

10) *White Christmas*
      *San Junipero*
      *USS Callister*
      *Black Museum*

Placing these episodes in any kind of sequence is difficult, but I think they all happen within a short time of one another – the time frame between Rolo Haynes’ transition from his neuroscience job to his death in the Black Museum. 


**The Era of the Beautiful People**

This ironically named era is the furthest into the future. 

11) *Nosedive*
      *Metalhead*
      *Men Against Fire*

I theorize that the events of these episodes happen at about the same time. The world of Nosedive is the world of the beautiful people, those who are left in proper society after all the roaches were thrown out or killed. Civilians are augmented with the rating system while soldiers are augmented with Mass. At this point, we have entered a totalitarian and brutal world. While an international military hunts roaches, civilians do not have to be overtly controlled by the government because they control each other via ratings instead, as they live in a world where one’s rating affects every aspect of their life. 

What about Metalhead? I propose it is not an apocalypse, but rather that all the humans seen in Metalhead are roaches and the dogs are military equipment designed to hunt them down and kill them. Perhaps the place in Metalhead is an area in which roaches were successful in waging a prolonged guerilla war. The military found it too costly to outright conquer this area, so they instead sent dogs to kill everyone.



And that’s the timeline. I want to emphasize again that the placing of Hang the DJ and 15 Million Merits are debatable, as is the question of whether 15 Million Merits takes place in the physical world and whether the sims in Hang the DJ are sentient.

1589,1534866562,994adx,False,3,7,"""Warning about future technologies and their effect on our society""; That was the gist of what I got as an answer when I asked around about this show. But I think the way more important thing this series does is how it brings up the darker side of the society and human nature. Many (but maybe not all) of the themes which are brought up in the show are actually timeless; The futuristic (and sometimes current) technology is more of a ""catalyst"" which is used to shed light on these psychological and societal factors so to speak.

Let me give two examples:

The episode "" Crocodile"" points out the fact that how fear and desperation can make the most descent people (at least according to their own self-image) to do things which were unthinkable to them before. Mia wasn't a psychopath. Although I still have a hard time believing that most people would go along the path she took, but I strongly believe this was the idea this episode tried to convey. Maybe this episode was exaggerated, but the core idea holds nonetheless. Now, here is the main point: The mind-reading technology in this episode was peripheral and unnecessary, but a very good tool to strengthen the plot.

Another example is "" Nosdive"". The main theme is obvious: people addiction to social approval and the possible destructive effect this addiction has. This is again a timeless theme in my opinion. The episode tried to push this to the extreme to show us its danger. I think the way Lacie and others in that episode tried to gain approval can be called quite rational in that world, but apart from that it was successful in showing the hazardous nature of social approval addiction.

Okay so am I the only one that thinks the manor in which people are punished in black mirror is pretty OTT? Like the guy that got off on pain the Black Museum was in a comma and we didn’t hear any more punishment from him after he killed the homeless man and probably broke several laws by delaying the treatment of patience just for his own sensations but Joe from ‘white christmas’ was locked in a cookie for the entirety of Christmas when each minutes = 1000 years of cookie time, with a constant blast of Christmas songs for what? He accidentally killed a man who was threatening him with a knife. Yes technically he killed the little girl but not intentionally and all of that was caused by him not being able to see ‘his’ daughter for (as far as he was concerned) no reason. 

The guy at the end of Black Museum is Permanently getting executed by electrocution for the murder of 1 woman (which he didn’t actually do) and the guy in white Christmas is banished from society because he helped some lonely guys get laid?

1594,1534829092,990gt6,False,3,8,"I remember before Season 4 I once voiced an opinion that I couldn't be sure the 'clones' in White Christmas were sentient and could feel pain (physical or emotional), rather than just complex computer programs with pre-programmed reactions.  Therefore I didn't fully buy into the shock value of the episode of the torture inflicted upon them.  A few people agreed with me but most didn't.

In season 4 we have similar situations with the digital consciousnesses involved in USS Callister and Black Museum with people showing revulsion to the torture inflicted on them.

So this makes me curious - why does nobody see any ethical dilemma in Hang the DJ?  While the digital versions in this episode are not 'tortured' as such, they are created, put through a series of forced relationships (not all pleasant) and then destroyed a couple of years later.  If these consciousnesses are indeed sentient then this forced servitude and then murder just for the sake of finding out how compatible two 'real people' are is also highly morally questionable at least.  Yet this episode is considered uplifting and happy and I have never seen this seriously questioned.

1626,1534581223,98a8yj,False,0,1,[removed],False,blackmirror,in your opinion what is the worst black mirror episode altho we all know all of them were good?
1627,1534578535,98a1sr,False,12,20,"So allow me to explain what I mean: USS Callister feels like Black Mirror has gone out of its own universe and is doing the very type of thing that some of the prior episodes warn about: a kind of 'justice porn.'

Compared to others in the series, it feels distinctly out of place, with the clear-cut 'bad guy' getting comeuppance for his 'wrong deeds.'

It feels like society enjoying laughing at the awkward, geeky/nerdy character and reveling in seeing him get punished for being such a weird freak. 

I imagine what some of you are probably thinking is: But of course in the context of the story, he's a terrible person, unquestionably. That's why he's so deserving of what he gets. 

But what awkward geeky/nerdy person hasn't had that experience of dealing with stereotypes of people thinking you do freakishly horrible/weird things in your off-time because you're a little awkward? I thought that stereotype was somewhat dying out, but this episode seems to revive it in full, playing with the idea that even private venting of issues on computer programs is not ok because ""oh no, they might be real.""

I've seen in discussions about this episode people say, ""He knew they were conscious."" Did he though? Am I forgetting an important and obvious detail? When is it actually implied, much less shown explicitly, that he sees them as conscious beings? As far as I can tell, for all we know, from his perspective, he is torturing people who are in no way real and it's little different from, for example, someone having a fantasy of raping someone else (e.g. it's not real - just a fantasy of having power in a fantasy world, as compared to the real world, where he feels powerless).

The questions raised by this episode seem paltry, if not completely missing. What are they exactly? It gets wrapped up far too well. The 'bad guy' loses, the apparently 'sentient AI' are unquestionably sentient and real, and we are given no reason to question this fact. 

If it is posing questions at video games in general, it seems to be coming from a position of ignorance. Of someone whose sole understanding of video games and those who play them is the absolute worst stereotypes of them. 

Worth noting, there is also a sense of elation to it, at the end. In a way, it is a joyful, satisfying conclusion. I think this causes some people to remember it more fondly than other episodes. But what lesson does it teach? That you should never fantasize because of the possibility that you could be hurting something with a real consciousness? 

Certainly he goes too far, in terms of creepily getting their DNA, but this in itself is not a horrific crime. It's just a creepy act as part of what is portrayed as a terrible crime. 

It's a strange episode for me and it seems to miss the very point the show makes more than once about the dangers of people reveling in justice brought down on others. The main character's end, after all, if we follow the foreshadowing, implies that he will probably die over it, slowly, while trapped in total isolation. Is this punishment fitting, even if we assume that he saw himself as torturing sentient beings? Or is it just 'justice porn'?

This episode seems like an unfair depiction of awkward/geeky/nerdy people and of video games in general. The reason this bothers me is not because it is inherently unfair to do such a depiction, but because it's such an easy target and one that plays well with the masses. Whereas many Black Mirror episodes seem about getting you to stop and question your assumptions, this one seems like it's playing right into assumptions and reveling in them. It doesn't make any point to draw a distinction between those who are awkward and normal, and those are awkward and evil. Instead, it focuses only on tropes of the worst of video game culture. The jokey part at the very end, while well executed, seems especially pandering to the perception that games are only played by bratty, childish people.

I want to like it and in many ways, I think it's a fun sort of episode, comparing to the dismal tone of many others. But it also seems like the low-hanging fruit and doesn't offer anything particularly notable to think about.",True,blackmirror,[Spoilers] USS Callister feels weirdly meta

It's a fan favourite, it touches on some great themes and it's one of the episodes that completely ruins my day when I watch it (... in a good way). But there are tons of little details that I think don't quite add up:

* What is (Cookie) Joe doing for the five years in the simulated cabin? He thinks he's doing some sort of job, but later can't remember. Either he was working, and the memory lapse is unexplained, or he wasn't, in which case we know neither what he was doing nor how the false memory of a job got there.
* Is (Cookie) Matt present for the five years in the cabin? He acts like he's been there and they've occasionally spoken, but how is that possible? He says to the officers that he tweaked the simulation so it felt like five years to Joe - implying that was before he entered the simulation. So how does Joe have memories of Matt? (And side question: how could the officers not realise about the five years when they were present in the room and could see the simulation controller screen with ""1826 days"" (or whatever) on the screen.)
* Why do things from Beth's dad's place keep appearing in the simulation as the episode progresses? It doesn't make sense in hindsight that the clock and snow globe would appear randomly. It also doesn't make sense that we would see Beth's daughter dead in the field (and how would she only make it 20 metres from the house before dying?).
* Joe hears a door slam shut in the cabin - is this in the simulation (what is that effect meant to achieve?) or in his head (what is he remembering? that sound doesn't occur in the flashback)?
* What is up with the final effect of the camera zooming out of the cabin, which is in a snow globe, which is in a cabin, which is in a snow globe, ...? Is it supposed to imply some nested reality (the simulation is within infinitely many more simulations)? Or is it just meaningless bullshit?

Does anyone have any answers to these questions? - I would love to just be missing something obvious, and for these all to make sense. Has anyone else been bothered by these things, and if so, does it affect your enjoyment of the episode?",True,blackmirror,White Christmas' tiny inconsistencies

1667,1534366002,97lvxl,False,5,46,"Hello, I know it's been a while since the episode premiered, but I saw it for the first time recently and a theory arose.

All the characters are part of a network of pedophiles. From the brain to the client.

Let's go by parts.

1: **Georgina Tarrington**, Involved by e-mail and racist jokes.

She gets involved in a scandal because of racism, but I'm sure she could go ahead with it or claim that they are false. But there is an important detail On the screen of the computer she's looking at, we can see that she's the CEO of the hotel chain [Wayheaven](http://es.web.img3.acsta.net/newsv7/16/10/26/09/36/225410.jpg), the same hotel that Hector was waiting for the prostitute.

It is responsible for providing a safe and discreet place.

A little related to what they asked her to do, provide, she provided the vehicle for Hector and Kenny

2: **Hector**, we know his story, a man who wants to ""try new experiences"", hiring a prostitute. 

What we do not know is what kind of prostitute. At the moment when the blackmailers contacted him, Hector wanted to vomit (And I'm sure he did). But thinking it over, is it worth an adultery to commit a bank robbery? I mean, cheating is bad thing, but is not something a Couple Therapy can not solve. No, it was something worse than infidelity.

Returning to Hector's hotel room, not only did he have lingerie, he had a **camera**.

Why would a man, who was afraid that his wife knew about his cheating, risk having evidence?

**Hector was waiting for an underage prostitute and filming child pornography.**

3:**The man on the motorcycle**. With this dude, we do not know anything, just the final scene of ""Are you a pervert now?"" of the end with the family.

With him, I'm sorry but I'll force the theory a bit in this part.

What if there is more symbolism in this part of what we really think.

He was the ""messenger"", the one in charge of delivering the package (the cake) to Kenny.

He was a distributor-seller of the pornography they filmed or sent him. The person in charge who was dedicated to the pornography reaching the customers.

That was his crime.

4: Finally, **Kenny** and the **Forest Guy**. ""I was just looking at pictures."" ""Me too."" we have **the** **customers**, those for whom there is a demand for that disgusting content.

With this, all are connected, which provides a safe place for pedophiles, who creates the content, who distributes it and who consumes it.

This is my theory, I hope it is understood. Tell me what you think",True,blackmirror,[Spoilers] Shut Up and Dance theory

1670,1534333608,97hke6,False,5,1,"Metalhead was a totally enjoyable episode for me, don’t get me wrong, but it felt so short that the twist (where it turns out she was just trying to get a teddy bear for a child) didn’t have that much of an impact. I think with some more length and some more background it could be one of the better episodes of the series.

The idea I had (not that I’m qualified to rewrite it) was what if the whole episode you’re watching the journey of all the characters (the three actual actors + the kid and other not shown characters), and throughout the entire thing they keep comforting the child by telling her “oh yeah when you find the bear, make sure to hug it in this certain way” or whatever, you know, to let her imagination take over the bleak reality. They get into this wear house, same as in the real episode, and they all get attacked by the metal creatures. The last two people alive are the main woman and the child, and the woman is about to be killed, unless the child intervenes. The child starts crawling towards the bear however, in what appears to be a moment of weakness. But as she hugs the bear in this special way, it releases some sort of signal that disarms the creatures. 

That’s my idea, and sorry it’s very rough and all over the place. ",True,blackmirror,I enjoyed the premise of Metalhead but I think it would have more of a Black Mirror feel if it was written differently.

Cooper is the tragedy that our technology and evolving intensity of recreation leave behind, and SaitoGemu's reaction to his death is our own.

Immersive psychological horror experiences or even just regular media like 13 reasons why have caused deaths much more directly by triggering people. None of this leads to change, to warning labels, to anything, because people who don't get caught in the cross fire still want the experience enough to pay for it.

1743,1533913615,967q7c,False,19,11,"BM is actually one of those shows that really does have diversity in the way each episode is filmed and the direction it takes, but it feels like most of it could be seen as a combination of just a few settings and themes. Spoilers(ish) ahead because some of the themes have to do with the twists that occur in the respective episodes. I think you could group them by

**Setting:** 

(1) Current world (same societal rules, current tech drives the episode)

(2) Slight future with particular new tech (same societal rules, new tech drives the episode)

(3) Distant future (dystopian future with totally different societal rules, episode draws comparison to our current society)

**Overarching Theme:**

(1) ""We're obsessed with social media/gawking.""

(2) ""Humans are capable of horrible things, tech makes it easier or drives us further.""

(3) ""If you try to recreate someone or clone their mind it will have unexpected consequences.""

(4) ""Our initial impressions of someone can be completely wrong.""

You can basically assign every episode to each of these categories, though I'll admit I have about 5 left to watch, mostly from the earlier seasons. A few episodes, especially in seasons 3-4 (when they've exhausted the themes alone) tap into two lessons, especially the human nature because that's a central theme of the entire show. Some of the ones that fit this scheme:

|Episode|Setting|Theme|
|:-|:-|:-|
|The National Anthem|Current World|Social media/Human nature tech|
|Fifteen Million Merits|Dystopia|Human nature driven further by tech|
|Be Right Back|Slight future, new tech|Recreating someone|
|White Bear|Slight future, new tech|Human nature/Initial impressions|
|Nosedive|Dystopia|Social media|
|Playtest|Slight future, new tech|Human nature driven further by tech|
|Shut Up and Dance|Current world|Human nature/Initial impressions|
|San Junipero|Slight future, new tech|Recreating someone|
|Men Against Fire|Dystopia|Human nature driven further by tech|
|Hated in the Nation|Slight future, new tech|Social media/Human nature|
|USS Calister|Slight future, new tech|Recreating someone|
|Arkangel|Slight future, new tech|Human nature driven further by tech|
|Crocodile|Slight future, new tech|Human nature driven further by tech|
|Hang the DJ|Dystopia|Social media/Recreating someone|

If you're looking for a Black Mirror fix*, On Children* is a Netflix Original Taiwanese Anthology series that is heavily inspired by Black Mirror. It includes similar premises and (the first episode at least) involves a destructive piece of technology. Each episode is a standalone story.

There are however a couple of key differences. 

Firstly, the show's focus is much more on paternal, familial relationships, and the pressures of youth. Since the series comes from Asia, where scholastic pressures are much much higher than in other parts of the world, this is what it seeks to satirize. Because of this the Science Fiction aspects take a back seat, but are the vehicles it uses to satirize Asian culture similar to how Black Mirror uses its Sci-Fi elements.

Secondly, the show branches out from Science Fiction, into more fantasy/magical realism elements in several episodes. The first episode, however, is indistinguishable from a Black Mirror episode if it wasn't for the fact that it's in Mandarin and was shot in Taipei.

Thirdly, the episodes are all 90-100 minutes each, however they still have a personal small-scale feeling that keep them from feeling like feature films.

I'm personally someone who didn't love Black Museum (didn't dislike it either, just wasn't super impressed) but I thought this plot line was really interesting and if it had the time of a full episode to explain the plot further and have more details could be a really interesting story (especially since a device like that would have serious benefits).

A big question raised that I think bears discussion is whether engaging in the hashtag would be ethical or not once the thing was going. That is, if we knew that someone was going to be killed because of it, is there an argument for engaging to try and make sure it is someone who ""deserves it""?

It’s got the plot twists, the “dark technology future” thing, and really just a general feel of suspense you get from Black Mirror. 

It’s about sectuplets (I think that’s the word—there’s 7 of them) who live under a “one child only” law and they all live as the same person. They’re named after days of the week—each girl going out on her corresponding day. Monday goes missing, and they try to find her.

The second one is “The Jaunt” by Stephen King, here the ironic punishment for being curious about how a technology really works is quite literally a fate worse than death. The punishment far far outweighs the indiscretion, yet the universe is completely indifferent. This is a common them in Black Mirror.

The common factor in the Black-Mirror-esque tech at the heart of them is both involve some kind of application that makes users do mysterious escalating favors for great rewards but that's their only commonality (besides centering around high schoolers).

The tech in Need is a website of that name where you type in what you want (doesn't have to be material but it has to be within reason e.g. no wishing for world peace or time travel or alien contact) and it gives you some sort of task to do as a ""price"" for what you asked for (task difficulty is equivalent to how hard it'd be for the people behind Need to give you what you ask for, quid pro quo). The main character wants her sick brother to get the kidney he needs and you can imagine what transpires after that (no, her task isn't to KO someone and steal their kidney, the Need people take care of the acquisition of the thing). And she isn't the only one in her town to ask such difficult things of it but she's the only one to start suspecting a hidden agenda behind the tasks.

By contrast, the application asking favors in Erebos is the titular WoW-Expy MMORPG that, in addition to the regular in-game quests, asks mysterious irl challenges as quests that reward characters with an auto-level-up and the only way you can get a hold of it is getting a copy from another player (in a very MLM-esque move, sometimes those ""irl quests"" ask players to recruit particular people it somehow knows they know)",True,blackmirror,Has anyone ever read the YA novels Need or Erebos?

San Junipero is still a classic Black Mirror episode - even though you think it is a happy ending, it isn't.  Why?  Because both of the main characters are dead.

For all the talk of consciousness uploaded to San Junipero, those are ultimately just digital copies of the originals.  The people in the real world don't get to live forever; they die.  You can map their neural pathways and imitate their physiological functions digitally, but those aren't the *same* neural pathways, or the same body; it is a copy.  The original dies.  There is no happy ending for the original characters - the happy ending is for the coded copies, a paradise for simulants inside a simulation.

This episode is brilliant.  The ending deserves more people to learn what really happened.  There may be happy-ending episodes of Black Mirror now, but this is not really one of them.  It is happy, it is sad, and it makes us consider our own inevitable mortality, feelings of love, and loss.",True,blackmirror,Just a reminder: San Junipero's ending and the truth behind it.

I've been reading a lot about the episode and would like to know what you think about the theory that he actually died in the first plane in a crash and never even got to start his trip??


Points of discussion:


1. When the mom calls him at first the only options in his phone are 'Answer' and 'Decline', but in the final scene there's 'Answer', 'Decline' and 'Message'. BM focuses to much in the little details for this to be an overlook. Maybe it means a message from above or beyond as the protagonist is dead??


2. It's weird that they show the plane 'shaking' or not having a smooth ride for no reason at all. That whole plane scene is kinda uncomfy and weird. Some of the passangers look worried and uneasy at the bumpy ride. Again don't think they included this randomly.


3. While on the plane, he's watching a movie with a HUGE spider on it and he's smiling and laughing at it, unlikely for someone who fears them so much even a little black spider freaks him out in the simulation. Maybe he started fearing spiders cause he relates it to the crash?


4. The air hostess asks him to please turn off his phone, which he does. But by then it could have already been too late. In the final scene in the computer, the woman (Kate I think?) writes ""Cause of crash: Phone interference"" which could be a reference to the plane incident.


5. When he meets his mom she looks like she has been crying, but his dad passed away at least 6 months ago if I'm not mistaken. She never mentions the dad but does mention him. ""Gotta call Cooper. Gotta make sure he's safe"" or something like that. That could imply that she feels guilty for not being able to talk to him and make sure he was safe before or during the trip. After he died on the plane she's traumatized and still tries to call him to prevent what happened, futelessly.

6. In the ""Called Mom"" observation in the end, it could be that he called for his mom while the plane was falling or that he literally turned on his cellphone back and called her. After the crash she could have tried calling back to no avail which is what left her so traumatized.


7. When he lost his money he wanted to call his mom but hesitated because he literally couldn't call her as he was already dead.

1930,1532554151,91w1w2,False,2,8,"I just noticed some concepts that made me enjoy the movie like a Black Mirror episode :

- robots feeling : more like the way the robots feel and how they manage with these feelings. Do they really feel or is this what they are supposed to do? Interesting thing to explore.

- synthetic prostitutes : idk why but such a thing they could make an episode with.

- relation with humans : how the humans can manage their feelings for a non-human robot that looks totally like them.

- shared memories : when the new Zoe forgives Cole because she has the memories of the first Zoe, it made me questioning the concept. Could some robots have the same memorie but react differently? Could them have an immediate memory to deal with? Like a connection of the whole squad of robots.

And for me the best concept for a BM episode :
- love pills : I don't really get why they introduced this concept in the movie but that's truly fascinating for me. The way they find a partner for taking the love drug together looks like the way some strangers make out for a night irl. Just living an one shot experience of what love could be.

I understand that it isn’t so much about the rebellion as it is about “fighting for love”; but my issue is that Frank and Amy are strong personalities, so the likelihood of them rebelling against the system were quite high to begin with. But what happens to those who just don’t have it in them? There are many personalities that are passive, does that mean the likelihood of them finding the perfect match via the system is slim to none? 

Another thing, at the end, Amy was able to freeze the system so they could escape, which goes to show that the other “people” were just part of the simulation. So my question is, was every date they went on just part of it? The way I’d assume it works (considering the basis of finding the perfect match is rebelling with your match) is that obviously it’s all about that one person, therefore every succeeding date after the first would be a horrible match, leading you to wanting to be with the initial, and how much you actually want that person.

When Kelly propositioned I had the obligatory ""Aww"" moment, but, since there was still 15 minutes to go, I prepared myself for someone to fuck something up.

And presto, it turns out Kelly only married Yorkie out of pity and the marriage was a hollow gesture of mercy. She has had (presumably) many years to think about this and wants to go the way of her husband and daughter into sweet oblivion. Classic Black Mirror tragic ending.

But then it all gets flipped on its head in five minutes, and apparently, in a couple of contemplative shots, Kelly decides to overturn a decision matured over decades of life and actually does go back to SJ.

I liked the episode, but I felt like that final twist was undeserved. Kelly went from ""You are selfish and foolish, I have made my decision"" to ""Alright guess I will spend eternity with you after all"" for no reason I could discern, other than shoehorning in the first happy ending in the series.

Have I missed something? What did Yorkie do to deserve the happy ending? Were the two 3-second-shots of contemplative Kelly meant to be her reconsidering her decision? 

I feel like the episode would have been much better, equally so, in either of two ways:

1. If it had been 10 minutes shorter and stuck with the tragic ending
2. If it had been 10 minutes longer and actually showed Kelly's development into deciding to forego oblivion for Yorkie

I am not in Brooker's brain, but it felt like he decided to turn the ending on its head at the last minute without realizing the episode only had a few more minutes to go.

I just watched ""Nosedive,"" my first ever episode of Black Mirror, and I have to say...I don't find the society depicted in this episode to be all that horrifying. A lot of my friends who recommended this one to me have told me that it was ""nightmare fuel,"" etc., but I don't really agree. Some thoughts:

1) That first elevator scene: I've been told and read on here that the elevator scene with Lacie and Bethany (?) is an excruciating one that really captures how shallow society in ""Nosedive"" is, but to me it honestly just came off as a typical ""office conversation"" you would have with some coworker you vaguely know. Unless your workplace is chill as hell, how chummy are you going to get with a coworker, especially one that is higher up than you (like Bethany seems to be with Lacie)? Your conversations are all pretty much going to be like theirs, and I think if they were trying to convey how awful this society was, they could've had Lacie speak with Ryan like that, or something. 

2) Behavior towards service workers: One benefit of the rating system was definitely how people have some big incentives to be nicer to service industry workers. I'm not going to talk a lot more about this aspect because I think it's fairly straightforward, but I did want to add that I've seen some people comment on how horrible the airport check-in woman was, and honestly as someone who used to work in retail and been screamed and cussed at for circumstances beyond my control, it was a pretty satisfying scene.

3) Upward mobility: This definitely goes both ways, and if you're unlucky like poor Chester the smoothie guy, you could very quickly go down in ratings, but I did think that those benefits you gain from getting a higher ranking are nice. I want a nice apartment but don't have quite enough money? Okay, I'll just post some pictures and be nice to people for a few months, and boom! I got it with a 20% discount.

2065,1531776232,8zf0i2,False,6,8,"I've been enjoying this show very much and it seems that one of the themes that keeps coming back is that of simulated consciousness on par with a real person's. Such a technology raises a lot of truly interesting questions, about what it means to be alive or conscious, and about the value of life among others.  


 But the little thing that struck me the most was that with such cheap simulation as we see in the episodes in which such technology exists, surely it wouldn't take long until a number of brilliant minds are cloned which would put people completely out of business. Scientific discovery would reach new heights, and at such astounding speed, that no human could possibly keep up with it. In one of the later episodes, for instance, we can assume that a couple thousand fully conscious and intelligent beings were simulated for several years within a few seconds ; all this, powered by a cellphone. 

All the engineers in the world doing, essentially for the most part, busy work would be but a droplet in a sea of intellectual manpower. Doctors and surgeons who, in real life, are being more and more assisted by machines (I'm thinking, for one, of very precise robotical arms which can be manned from afar, as well as diagnostics software) would only have the added value of being an actual person versus such a simulation which could, itself, use these tools directly. Even judges, lawyers, teachers, politicians, could they compete with simulated copies of brilliant minds with centuries if not millenia of experience?   


You could have countless simulated teachers in front of a million simulated classes, perfecting their craft, and it might take a few hours for a desktop pc to run the simulation. You'd then just replicate the highest scoring simulation and have them teach instead of real people or whisper directives into someone's ears. Could it be that, in this future, only the less qualified jobs still hold for real people? The ones that, traditionnaly, expect little more from you than a healthy body or humane qualities. Only this, I imagine, these simulations can not offer.

Also, the construction site factory would have ALSO had a bunch of security cameras all over the place.

2087,1531642801,8z0ah4,False,19,37,"This is something I was pondering when I rewatched parts of Black Mirror recently, and I realised that the episode I have the most problems with is 'White Christmas', which I know sounds mad because it's a consistent fan favourite, but I hope some people would hear me out on this.

The episode's emotional core, acting, pacing, and twist ending all make the episode work... but I have major problems with the internal logic of the fictional universe this episode presents. Most episodes of Black Mirror, such as 'Be Right Back', 'Arkangel', and 'The Entire History of You' (as examples) do a great job establishing the practical use of the technology the episode is dealing with before exploring its consequences on society; White Christmas, not so much...

First of all, the episode introduces the concept of the eye-implants which allow you to 'Block' people. The problems with this are immediately self-evident; that'd be far-out dangerous. You can't get yourself unblocked, even in an emergency. That's not so much of an issue, really, as the episode establishes that everyone has this eye-implant, so it's relatively normalised... But at the end of the episode, we see that Matt is physically incapable of being properly seen or heard by anyone. Can he just go around shoplifting now? How is his identity verified? Can he buy food at all? If he gets mortally wounded in some way, will he even be able to call an ambulance? There's just so many gaping questions about how this is supposed to work.

However, my main issue with the episode is the presentation of the 'Cookies', as shown in the second ""mini-story"" of this episode...

 Sometimes when watching Black Mirror you have to make certain concessions that this hypothetical technology ""just works"" in order for the world they set up to make sense, and that's fine. But 'Cookies' are an idea that I cannot for the life of me make sense of as a concept.

1) If Cookies are supposed to be a complete copy of your entire conscious self (up until the point its removed). So then why doesn't it remember having a Cookie made of itself? Matt has to explain the Cookie how the real her agreed to have one made. Wouldn't it remember that if it's supposed to have all the same memories?

2) A Cookie is conscious (obviously, that's the main conceit of the episode) and completely disconnected from the real person. This means that a Cookie's memories will eventually ""diverge"" from that of the Cookie's owner after so many months or years, eventually impacting preferences and personality... which means the Cookie's conception of its real-self's preferences will no longer be accurate and you'll need to have a new one made, which involves surgery to get the Cookie implanted, a week for the Cookie to scan and copy your mind, and surgery to remove it again.

3) The episode does nothing to establish *why* Cookies need to be conscious in order to operate the way that they do... outside of knowing exactly how you like your toast and when to make it (???) (I guess because using a timer on the toaster is somehow less practical for the human user? You still need to get up and put the bread in the toaster yourself and retrieve it? This is such an odd proof-of-concept, I don't know why they went with it.) Also it organises a daily planner. Again, the Cookie obviously has no knowledge of what's happening in your real life, so how is that useful?

4) The Cookie is trapped in a plain stark-white room for all eternity and presumably never ages. The Cookie's owner, on the other hand, is out living a real life; meeting new people, trying new foods, working a job, watching films and TV, going on holidays... while the Cookie spends all of eternity in a plain room interacting with nothing but the air-conditioner controls and the toaster. The Cookie can't really have too much of an intimate knowledge of the real person's preferences, because every day is going to be slightly different and impact a person's wants and needs in so many ways it'd be impossible for a Cookie to account for all of these changes. What if this person goes out drinking one night or stays late at work and needs an hour's extra sleep in the morning before ""optimal"" waking time? The Cookie has no way of being able to adjust for all these variables because it's only as smart as the person who made it and can't ""re-sync"". It's entirely possible that a Cookie's performance at keeping all household conditions optimal will only work as desired for as little as a few days...

It is a creepy concept, to have a tiny min-slave of yourself living in virtual reality but the execution of this is so ridiculous I found it distracting, and it ended up detracting from my enjoyment of the 'twist' ending being a callback to the Cookie idea.",True,blackmirror,"I love Black Mirror, but am I the only one who has major problems with the much-loved 'White Christmas'?"

And look i would say there are two extremes on this situation and there are both wrong:

-Pedophiles that say they should be part of the LGBT community because they shouldn't sexuality means what gender you are atracted with and the sexual intercouse

-People that say that all pedophiles should die because they are all horrible people and that isn't exactly true as much as the general society doesn't want to believe it YOU CAN'T CHOOSE to be sexually atracted to kids in the same way a Bipolar person can't choose to be bipolar so where does the line end?To self control to change there are huge stigmas with people with mental disorders in general saying they are violent they all should die trying to forget that all the person doesn't revolve around the mental disorder if you never knew Kenny was a pedophile and there was a happy endings and the hackers gave him what he wanted?Would you have suspected in him in the first place because the only thing he was doing was molesting.

-But Pedophiles molest people

-Just because they are pedophiles?

 And the country where i live the act of having Zoophilia  is ilegal but having Zoophilic pornography in itself and it still makes it wrong

What he was doing was morally wrong and i kinda like the fact that this is the only episode that could make you see at least both points of views in pedophilia.

But no maybe i have a way too positive view on life and guess that is thanks to black mirror(kinda ironically) but just try to see yourself in this situation whatever you do you would be fucked up.Kenny is just a child(He is like 18) but not a guy on his 40's or 50's he still has a lot of life left,there is no way he is the same person in 20 years .

Because as much as people don't want to admit it the solution to ''end'' pedophilia is not to kill these people but to help them i know it is not easy and it can't apply to people that are violent but on his case? if people helped them none of this would have happend and he would have been watching regular porn like teenagers his age do i know it is not an easy situation as it is probably the mental disorder the worst view on society it takes years even decades and as i much as people don't want to see it,people can change.",False,blackmirror,Unpopular Opinion:Kenny on Shut Up And Dance is not Evil

Finally, characters who only hurt cookies and not human beings lose Evil Points since we can give them the benefit of the doubt of cookies not being sentient.  


The cheating wives from TEHOY and White Christmas do not fall in this rating, since their ""crime"" is too petty to fall in the same category of Mr. Ikillfourhundredthousandpeoplebecausef\*ckyouthatswhy and Mr. Isetupamuseumwherepeoplecanelectrocuteahumanlikeartificialintelligence.  


The suicide-murderer woman from White Christmas too isn't present since she's clearly non compos mentis. The dogs from Metahlead also aren't present because they are not human and likely just do what their code tells them to do.  


So, here's the rating from the least evil to the most evil:  


1. **Carlton Bloom**, the artist from The National Anthem (while kidnapping a person and causing an alarm that shuts down the whole UK for a day is pretty screwed up, he didn't harm the princess nor her security, and he didn't even wanted the Prime Minister to actually make love with a pig, so he's definetely the least evil one)
2. **The three judges** from 15 Millions Merits (I know manipulating a woman into porn is evil, but you have to put it into the perspective of the whole society wanting it)
3. **Baxter** from White Bear (He does pretty screwed up shit to a woman, but again when you see the whole crowd cheering for it you feel the fault falls on the whole society)
4. **The hacker(s)** from SUAD
5. **Matt Trent** from White Christmas (he's a torturer indeed, but only cookies and he isn't shown to believe that cookies have sentience, and also the whole society belives cookies don't have human rights)
6. **Robert Daly** from USS Callister (a step higher than Matt since his purpose for torturing cookies is enslaving them to live his wicked power fantasies)
7. **The policeman** from White Christmas who sentences Joe's cookie to millions of years in a room listening to the same song (loses Evil Points just because of the societal factor. But that's a gratuitous act of evil. Daly at least was doing it because of a mental illness)
8. **Rolo Haynes** from Black Museum (he made his business around torturing cookies. Also, he is shown to believe cookies have sentience)
9. **Garret Scholes** from HITN (you just don't kill 400k people because you don't like them, I don't care if you believe they had it coming)
10. **Jack Napier** from The Waldo Moment (the generic tyrant without any real ideology who only cares about gaining power)
11. **Mia Nolan** from Crocodile (she has plenty of time to think back about her actions, feels no sincere remorse, kills a f\*cking toddler, isn't convinced she's acting for a higher purpose. Just no.)
12. **Arquette** from Men Against Fire (It is true that he has an ideology behind him and so the fact that he thinks he's acting for a higher purpose might make him lose points. But this ideology is literal nazism, and the fact that the government has to hide what they do to the public means the ideology wouldn't be accepted by the current society.

As long there no is, everything's fine to me, I'm just curious if its intended and if there are some statements from the developers of the show.
I seems to me like no coincidence that every protagonist in the lastest season was solely female.

I love this show but I'm not a fan of the premise when such episodes originate from the sort of somer agenda, especially because I think Season 4 was the weakest overall. 
Which should not mean that it's the fault of the choice of their protagonists, but when their first priority was to enforce minoritys, than maybe they disctracted to much from their primary goal of creating a superb show.

I'm really into diversity and I like that this series has so much different protagonists from an ethical standpoint, much better than those typical hollywood clichee's but I'm a bit worried that they just try to hard to not implement... well... people like me.
Just because to boast about diversity. 
Don't get me wrong it doesn't matter in the end, but I'm worried that it sometimes goes to a point where a story just feels forced, I did have some of this vibes in Episode 4x03 which seemed to me like it was better suited for a male role... I don't know but I wasn't impressed of the performance of the actor.

What really struck me as similar was an episode in Season 4 (first season I've watched, just saw it on TV and checked it out) and this guy, John, was vividly upset because he believed he had found true love in this girl, but the computer algorithm told him that she wasn't his perfect match, and therefore, he should no longer pursue her, for the sake of winning the game.

Regarding the cookies in White Christmas.  I get that Matt breaks them mentally in order to get them to comply.  I understand that by the time they have been alone with nothing to do, the idea of running the functions of the house seems appealing, and the alternative is their hell.  But I do find it strange that Matt has seemingly never had a situation where the cookie attempted to rebel, and do something like burn the house down or sabotage the person's life.  He may have put safeguards in place to prevent something like that from happening, but I feel like even just doing a shitty job would be an act of rebellion that a cookie would try at some point.  This may have been talked about in the episode but it's been a little while since I've seen it.

Why not alter the cookie's mind so that it's not an ""exact"" copy of the host?  It seems like the technology would be able to take away, or at least reduce the cookie's desire to be free and have a mind of their own.  In it's place they could implement a desire to do anything for the host, and make running the house their passion as well as their priority.

At the end of most episodes there’s a twist that changes the entire episode and almost every one is told in an extremely unique way. There’s one told in security cam footage, one told without any dialogue, one filmed in the style of a 70s horror, one told backwards and one told in  memories. The one thing all episodes have in common is that the story plays entirely inside of the number nine. It could be a shoe size, an apartment number or an address. The two writers Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton play the main roles in most episodes, which is also pretty interesting to see. Seasons 3 and 4 can be found on netflix, 1 and 2 are on britbox I believe, but you‘ll be able to find them somewhere in the dark corners of the internet fairly easily. I highly recommend you this series, as it really is amazing. Some especially good episodes are se2 ep2 „12 days of christine“, se1 ep2 „A quiet night in“, se4 ep2 „bernie cliftons dressing room“ and „tom and gerri“ (forgot which episode that one is). [Here](https://youtu.be/71YO8veX7wM) is an amazing video that reviews the entire show and „12 days of christine“ in particular. But do keep in mind that the amazing twist of that episode will be spoiled for you. That‘s all, I found this series after finishing black mirror and I honestly think it‘s even better than bm.

2268,1530459535,8vapdo,False,5,22,"The dry walls of Scott’s airy mansion had once been painted a dark shade of blue. It had always been his favourite colour. He remembered his days as a young schoolboy, always having to respond to the question regarding his favourite colour with the same old boring response. Blue was after all possibly the most mainstream response for boys to this question at that age; girls of course chose pink. Scott did not like the popularity blue enjoyed since he viewed his connection with blue to be deeper than that of the other boys, but he could never put it in words or even justify it to himself in his young mind.

The dark shade of blue on his walls had by now met the same fate as his favourite shirt. Living all alone within those dry walls lay Scott, a man who had experienced everything and nothing, just wishing for something more. He wasn’t sure what it was that he was pining after. He had achieved everything that he had been told to achieve. His schooling had yielded great results for him both academically and socially, registering a whopping 372 Peers, just falling short of Pete Smith’s 386. He went on to attend Dalrymple University, the most elite engineering school in the country. There too, he registered 564 Peers, which was a great achievement considering the University had only 700 students. This helped him land a well-paying job with space giants BLASA, where he had worked for the past 22 years. Somewhere past his 4th year of working at BLASA, Scott had purchased the house he was now laying pensively in. 

By all standards of measurement Scott’s life had been a roaring success. He was treated cordially by most people, as his Peer stats had shown throughout his life. He had purchased his own house, car, and drew a handsome salary at BLASA. He had climbed up the ranks over the years, now holding the position of Director. He had donated his sperm at age 28 as was required and had been informed that his contribution had led to a successful birth when he was 33. There were times when he wondered who it was that had been borne out of his sperm and who it was that had given birth to this child. But these thoughts were highly infrequent and emerged purely out of curiosity and boredom. He knew that the answers were inconsequential. 

He couldn’t say that he was unhappy. How he felt now was how he had felt his entire life. Happy. He had lived the life everyone had lived. He had grown up in the same school, the same hostel, gone to a better university than most, worked at a better company than most, and earned more money than most. He was certainly happy. Yet there seemed to be something which poked at him. A feeling of unfulfillment, perhaps. How he had essentially felt his entire life. Nothing had changed. Nothing was going to change. He would grow older, and in 15 years he would kill himself, as everyone did. Making himself a scotch-on-the-rocks, he walked out to his garden where he noticed the drying walls. “I ought to get them repainted,” he thought to himself.

About 4 months ago I started Series 3 of Black Mirror. I saw Nosedive, got thinking about the episode (and China) and watched Friends for a while. I always watch one Black Mirror episode a week, leaving me time to think. So a week later I watched Playtest.

I ended up not watching Black Mirror for about 2.5 weeks, but got back into it when a dance at school was coming up and I started to get a little depressed because I can't find a date (it was a formal.). So I watched Shut Up and Dance.

That episode did 2 things to me. 1) I wasn't depressed anymore, I was kinda scared and 2) I became really paranoid with anything that has a camera.

When Martha tried to force the faux Ash over the cliff, he breaks down and begins to beg for his life. So to me that has to mean one of two things...

1. The faux Ash is now a robot with a will to live. You don't need to watch many sci fi horror films to know that keeping a self aware robot with a will to live in your attic is going to end badly. Or... 

2. He is still a robot, and while he will try to avoid his destruction to continue fulfilling his purpose, he does not fear death.

So why the crying and the 'Please, don't. I'm scared'?

We know that everything that faux!Ash says is something that real Ash said during his lifetime, right? Through email, texts, Tweets... videos, etc. Is it possible that he was parroting something that he knew the real Ash would say in this situation?

Now, it's implied that Ash died in a car crash, distracted by his phone. Please correct me if I missed something, because I could have, but while it's implied, it is never explicitly stated how Ash died. (Again, please correct me in the comments if this isn't right!) 

So if we're to suppose that Ash really spoke those words at some point in his life... Why? When? Did he run into trouble in his past? Or were we hearing Ash's real last words through the mouth of faux!Ash? We know how often Ash used his phone, so it's plausible if he was in danger, his last moments were somehow recorded.

2378,1529529707,8sm43o,False,5,13,"There are some companies in BM like TCKR, that create machines that are cruely inhumane. Also nearly all research is done by private organisations.

Even we learned that the EU banned the archangle program and the UN banned the Teddys, there are many technologies that clearly should be banned, but aren't. This kind of reminds me of some sort of night watchman state.

Also after the bee catastrophy some privat company took over ... and saved the UK from the apocalypse?! A pretty big resposibility for a company.

Even a war against large scale of people is fought by a private milita instead of the US army or another federal force.

While federal science seems to have been consumed by private science, federal legislation for scientific research is also nowhere to be found. I don't know whatever tech is behind the White Bear attraction park, but my guess would be in our world some federal agencies would test this tech before it could be used on anyone ... yeah also convicted killers.

While this seems very strange, the shift of federal science to private science has already started. With a company like Alphabet Inc. ""owning"" 1,2% of the WORLDS GDP some sort of anarcho capitalism isn't that far fetched.

In todays science we also see private companys slowly out passing federal organisatons. For example: Space X, Blue Origin (NASA, ESA) or TAE Technologies in the field of fusion power.

While private companies are far more after money than the goverment and far less concerned about public safty they test unfinished products in order to make more money quickly (Playtest, Archangle, Black Museum).

If you aren't convinced by now I have a last clue that hints directly to my hypothesis. Nosedive, Entire History of You and White Christmas. In all these episodes we see eye lenses, that are most likly designed by some private corp (I'm only 100% sure about Entire History of You, we see an add for the lense.) But even if they are private they are used by the goverment in Nosedive the Security Guad on the airport sets her on double damage and removes one star, in EHOY the airport security checks him with a look into his implant and in White Christmas they block his vision and block him from the other people. That all reminds me of the punishment for cyber crimes that these users aren't allowed use the internet anymore, but are in a waaaay more cruel way.

VERSE 1:
She came to your aid
As you finished your kool-aid
You gave out a soft gaze
To keep up with her pace

Don't fidget in your denim jacket
Lost and cold, smile you should try it
Grab her hand you'll own the dance floor
But you ran down through the back door

You said
""I am new in town
With a long face and a frown
And I walked from so far
Just to get to this bar""

“Cause I wanna break free, but I don't know
Where do we go?

Breaking my soul
Take me back now take me back now”

VERSE 2:
You watched the sunsets
And danced under blankets
You've got all the hype
But you kept track of time

Don't give it all, cause you might fall down
Down the line of a massive fallout
She's unsure of this adventure
Gotta keep your own composure

She said:
""I never felt this way
And I don't think I can stay
And I'll always stay the same
At the end of the day""

CHORUS:
""Cause
I wanna break free
But I don't know, where do we go?
This world of 1s and 0s
An ache in my soul
Take me back now, take me back now""

BRIDGE 1:
""I'll see you next week darling
I hear the bells are ringing
I'll keep this short and simple
Let's turn this into something""

BRIDGE 2:
“Oh, we look so good, in our white dresses
Drive this truck down, we are home bound
Oh, we look so good, in our white dresses

- When Yorkie is playing video games and a boy comes up to ask her to play video games, he asks her to play Topspeed. Yorkie sees the timer count from 3 to zero and then the car crashes, foreshadowing the ending of the episode. It is also a reference to her own car accident that paralyzed her.  

- Wes makes multiple comments about how much time he has left, implying Wes is a tourist and not a resident. Kelly also asks Yorkie if she is a tourist or resident, to which she replies it is her first time in San Junipero. 

- Yorkie makes reference to the fact that
her family thinks she can’t do anything while she and Kelly were talking in the rain, obviously a tip to her paralysis. 

- When Kelly tries to come on to Yorkie, Yorkie makes the excuse that she is engaged to someone named Greg, who Kelly notes as “elsewhere;” we learn later that Yorkie wants to marry Greg, her doctor in reality, in order to be euthanized and become a resident. 

- After Kelly and Yorkie have sex, Kelly notes that she was married once, alluding to the fact that Kelly’s husband, Richard, died and chose not to be uploaded (for he believed in an afterlife).

He was charged with homicide with cruel cruelty and a lawsuit against the manslaughter of the Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén County Attorney General for two offenses committed in February 2018 for a violation of his personal freedom.

According to the description, the defendants were entertained in a pub in Dimore in February and clashed with a man. ""Since the victim's allegations were found to be offensive, the two men and women were determined to kill,"" the prosecution says.

In the pub she was offered to take her to the neighboring village, her relatives. In the car, blades and a brush cutter were pre-loaded. The victim's partner was also with them, who did not want to let go of the couple alone with the defendants, knowing their violent nature. They started, but they did not go for the planned destination, but to Putnok. When this was reported by the injured, one man cut the man's neck with the knife. They threatened their life partner with a life threatening.

Putnoni stopped at the cellar of a dwelling house, where the heavily bleeding victim and the woman who had been scared to death were forcibly removed. In the basement, the two men were brutally kicked and twisted with the knives and scrubbing knife while the woman with them shone with a cell phone in the dark.

The victim's companion was forced to see all this, while his thigh was also stabbed and threatened with killing him. When the victim died, one man went up to the house where his partner lived. He awakened the woman and asked him to help get rid of the body. They were twisted into a carpet and then taken back to the Plant by a car and thrown into a digger pit. Meanwhile, Putnos, the accused man's partner, burned the clothes and the tools to get rid of the clues.

The murdered man's partner was held up until dawn, and then let him kill him if he was talking about what happened. The defendants were captured the same day and arrested in advance.

The prosecution proposed a jail sentence against the two men and their assisted woman for a life sentence for a woman involved in the disappearance of traces.

At first I was confused and thought it was only 70 mins, since he's a real person and only 70 mins had passed IRL. But then cookie Joe saw himself living together with Matt for 5 years, during which he probably saw Matt every day. How could Matt act out 5 years of living with cookie Joe if it was only 70 mins from his perspective? Plus it would mean his conversation with Joe in the episode happened within a few IRL seconds, which would be impossible for any real person to accomplish unless he's secretly the Flash.

5 years would make more sense, but that brings another question: why 5 years? I understand the point is to make Joe break down and submit, just like what was done to Greta. But all Matt did was to sit down and share his stories with Joe over a few glasses of wine, and that was enough to bait Joe to confess. So why didn't Matt attempt to talk to Joe at all in the past 5 years? If i recall correctly, Joe said something like ""You never really talk to me at all, why now?"".

I just got to San Junipero and I have some thoughts I want to process. I scrolled through some old discussion threads and couldn't find anyone who vocalized quite this aspect of the episode, so here are some of my thoughts:

Yes, it was a happy ending; yes, it was a relatively upbeat episode overall. But it was still a horribly sad ending in many ways. I was absolutely shocked that Kelly decided to stay in San Junipero permanently. It made me really happy, though -- the immediate satisfaction of this adorable couple staying together, the gratification from knowing that Yorkie gets a chance at experiencing the parts of life she missed out on the most. However, Kelly's emotional rant after she slapped Yorkie her last night on the temporary plan had some really, really good points. Yorkie looked like the dumb Disney princess at that point, believing that their marriage was real after a handful of dates when Kelly had experienced decades and decades of sorrow, joy, and deep companionship with a man who she had no reason to stop loving. I felt wrong and selfish, too, for wanting Yorkie and Kelly's relationship to turn out. I have no idea what Kelly/Richard's relationship was like, but 49 years of a healthy marriage is a powerful thing.

Something about all that gives the show a sorrowful twist to me. I'm surprised Kelly went back on her unspoken vow with her husband. But I do still feel satisfied that Yorkie gets her desires granted and also gets a shot at a potentially long, loving marriage. I think this episode, in a lot of ways, is just as sad (and certainly just as complex) as any other episode of Black Mirror.

Another thought is that I'm certain my interpretation of this episode is heavily influenced by the worldview I bring to it -- one that suspects an eternal afterlife, and, therefore, one that would wonder if Kelly's husband and daughter are waiting for her. Suspecting that Kelly's family moved onto another life and she chose against following them changes the tone of every decision made in the show. 

Nearly every episode of Black Mirror acts as a truly good piece of art, forcing my worldview to interact with it, forcing me to determine truth from it -- but this episode has done so very uniquely. I love it.

2466,1528918951,8qvdu4,False,3,18,"Most posts I found on Nosedive was about it's critical message towards social media. I also saw many voice complaints that it wasn't subtle enough and lacked depth, unlike the other episodes. Imo, yes, it was critical about social media, but that was just the first layer, which I felt was done to be purposely obvious. Here are some things I noticed. What do you all think?

When Paul finishes his speech at the wedding, he immediately goes over to Anthony. They do the intimate chest bump and lock eyes. He's so wrapped up in the moment that he never once looks at Naomi \- his new wife! Not only that but the way the boys grabbed each other tightly and nearly kiss reveals the suppressed sexual tension between them. Most likely they're a couple under the guise of a bromance, hence the intensity and the longing gaze. In Paul's speech, he literally tells Anthony he loves him, but he only gives big thanks to Naomi (bc they're obviously just social ladders for each other). Naomi's expression reveals that she is aware that Paul is gay and that he has a relationship with Anthony. It also shows that she is uncomfortable with the fact that they're homosexual.

Also, Paul jokes ""by your standards"" in his speech (in ref to Anthony's speech), then in the chest bump scene, the ""you earned it,"" reveals that Anthony was Paul's Lacie. Anthony was a low 4 pointer that would get ranked higher from being in a high 4 environment and Paul would rank up for being that nice, charitable friend for helping a low 4 pointer. The only difference is that he happens to actually like Anthony while Naomi has always treated Lacie like crap.

The excitement shared between Paul and Anthony seems to stem from how they've both stepped up in their ranking and thus securing the upper tier of the upper social class. For Paul/Naomi who are already there, it takes a lot to actually maintain the status, so I imagine the grand wedding/charity gestures were done in order to ensure some months of peace of mind. (IRL ranked games such as LoL follow this \- if you don't continue to prove yourself in that rank, you'll drop.) So there's that going for Paul and Anthony and, they probably can be more intimate with each other bc to everyone, Paul's happily married now \- so less suspicious. Their happiness is probably the most real in the wedding.

Why hide his sexuality? Black Mirror worlds reflect our own \- current state just in futuristic settings. So in Nosedive, while yes, there are probably other non\-straight people out there walking about, it doesn't change the fact that people are still discriminatory towards any non cis\-gendered white folks. People finding out Paul is gay would cause him to lose his ranking.

People have also pointed out that generally, the upper middle class (&amp; upper upper class) who have higher rankings than others are mostly white. The black woman with the high 4 that Lacie bumps into is equivalent to how it's still possible to jump into the upper class, but the lack of diversity illustrates that it's just so much more difficult and rare. Lacie's consultant explains that in order to score high, your inner social circle must consist of other high ranking people. In real life, most people claim it's all about hard work but this Nosedive system literally tells you no, it's not. It's kind of obvious bc that's the only way for many of the audience to notice. We're too used to our flawed system to see anything wrong with it otherwise. In the Nosedive world, much like ours, if you're not white and straight, people are more prone to rank you lower (because you'd then be the ""other"" \- the starting point for the ""norm"" is a cis white male). Also, even from everyone's outfits, they all kind of look the same \- not much individuality due to fear of putting someone off.

There's basically hardly any leeway for acceptance or tolerance. Any indicator of different just starts you off with a disadvantage and we all saw how quickly your rank would fall. (IRL \- credit score, grades, etc. \- hard to rise but easy to fall). The shallow ranking system just shows how stupid it is to discriminate or pass judgment against others based on appearances or one\-off interactions. The social media aspect was mainly a means or tool to point out the discrimination that happens in all fronts of life. Besides the social media critique, everything else seems to be on the subtler side bc it'd be chaotic to emphasize everything. It does shine some light and I think that just plays along with how it all appears in the real world.",True,blackmirror,"Nosedive - Other themes, not just social media"

Even if you decide to use the app on someone who you're fairly compatible with, but ultimately wouldnt end up with, you're sending 1000 sentient copies of yourself through the ringer to arrive at the conclusion that the real you doesnt really like them. Remember, the app doesnt put the two people together in a particular setting that is designed to test the boundaries of their compatibility, it generates thousands of versions of them for the app to play with.

These test subjects are essentially slaves, and the metric used to determine what constitutes a successful trial is completely arbitrary and, I'd argue, not the best indicator of long term viability. Looking at the particular situation they're placed in, one could argue that an ideal partner wouldn't want her to possibly commit suicide just for the possibility of being with her. 

Basically, if you're using this app, you're trusting a completely unknown entity to put potentially infinite versions of you into good places.

I know there’s already been a few discussions created about this, and I apologize for that, but I just started watching this show last Saturday, and I have to say, it’s outright amazing. 
However, I was discussing with my girlfriend about the episode, White Bear, and she saw it too, and immediately told me she was scarred? When I asked why, this is what she said, 

“The concept of the episode shouldn't be allowed to exist. Such a flagrant, state-sanctioned and community-supported violation of human rights, arguably a fate worse than death, sickens me”

I responded with this, 

“I understand where you’re coming from because it is over the top. But I mean, I understand the outrage, and I’m not justifying the punishment. She filmed a child being murdered. That’s sickening all by itself. You had the gall to deliberately video tape a child, kidnapped, might I add, being gruesomely murdered in the hands of her boyfriend.
To be honest, I can’t imagine being in the mind of that woman, and even though her punishment is outright cruel and unusual, I do have to sympathize with the emotion backed by the people.

Now, this where she lost me. She replies,

“Maybe it would have been different, if when I finished watching, I and everyone else around me agreed that it was ridiculous and horrible and whatever other words I could think of. People always empathize with the townspeople, though. There must be something there I don't understand. It terrifies me. It makes me feel like it could happen, if people can always relate. And of course it could. A person thought of it, after all.
I really don't care what she did. I don't care if she was Hitler. No one deserves that. But I guess that's an unpopular opinion.”

Hitler? Hitler??
When I question her about Hitler, she responded,

“No, he doesn't. He's human. It shouldn't matter what any person did. There are some lines we shouldn't cross when dealing with other people. I truly believe that.”

I asked if what Hitler did truly be classified and justified as “human”, and she replied,

“Yes. Humans can be cruel creatures. He was one. But that doesn't mean we should follow suit.”

She followed that text with, 

“We're probably not going to agree. It's just two different ethical perspectives. And if my class has taught me anything, it's that I'm a total hypocrite with that. I have no room to judge. But I guess that's something you should know. I'm against the death penalty, the idea of Hell is revolting, I favor redemption over revenge wherever possible. Etc. But easy for me to say, looking from the outside in”

Any thoughts or opinions on this, I’m honestly at a loss of words. If you take the Black Mirror episode and you were REPLACE the main character with Adolf Hitler, does that change things? Is this punishment more suitable for someone committed genocide, essentially attempting to exterminate the Jewish?
We were just looking for different takes.

My first complaint is that at the end of the episode, the actors are seen setting up for the exact same scenes that played out the previous day, implying that they assume that she does the exact same thing every time they wipe her brain which seems like a huge oversight, because what if it doesn't work? In that case, she'd probably roam around and maybe even find her way out of the White Bear area, which leads me to my second problem with it. It's way too elaborate, and most of it doesn't have a purpose. I understand that the people are ordered to stand around recording with their phones because that's what she did during the murder of the kid, but what was the point of setting up a post apocalyptic town with actors portraying survivors and hunters with the strange masks and the idea that they had to shut down the white bear radio station?

I did feel for the kid insofar as he could be young and dumb and not thinking about the plications of watching real children, that it meant a real child had gone through that. There was a woman in my abuse survivors therapy group who was attracted to children (it's more common than people realise when someone's gone through what this woman went through) and she'd draw pictures, write fanfiction, and admitted to doing what Kenny did (although when she was younger, at 13/14 or so).
But the first scene with the way he talks/ stares at the girl.. this isn't a kid with a fetish who hasn't yet figured out that he's ruining lives - this is a guy who knows exactly what he's doing and doesn't care! Obviously vigilante justice is a hugely flawed concept in itself, but I mostly see discussions about whether he did/ didn't deserve it and for those who felt badly for him, the main argument seems to be that he's a hormonal adolescent who can't help who he's attracted to! And no of course he can't, but his actions in that moment seem to me really predatory. 

I'm curious to know if I'm judging his ""nice gesture"" too harshly (I mean if I notice a woman leave something behind and point it out to her, that doesn't mean I'm thinking ""yeah we should bang!"")

Let me start by getting this out of the way, the shock value of the National Anthem doesn't bother me. Never the less I always tell people to skip the first episode when I recommend the show, because the writing is honestly just bad. 

It's like an exercise in frustration, watching every single character act incredibly illogically, blindly trusting a terrorist to keep his word, even though he's obviously trying to make some kind of statement and get a reaction. How did no one say the words *""We don't negotiate with terrorist""* at any point?

The first time I watched the episode I honestly expected the terrorist to just kill the princess/his hostage anyway after he, against all odds, managed to make the prime minister fuck a pig on live TV.

I actually think the episode had an interesting premise, i was interesting seeing how the media dealt with it. But I felt like the moment the writers came up with the premise they decided that this episode have to end with the prime-minister fucking a pig, at any cost. No matter how much we have stretch common sense, and no matter how unbelievable it might be. 

And yeah I get you have to sustain your disbelief to some extend with entertainment, but no even questioned the trustworthiness of the terrorist, no one seemed to realize that going along with his demands didn't guarantee the princess's life. 

All in all it's so far out it feels more like more like a silly drama rather than some kind of meaningful criticism of society. ",True,blackmirror,"In the National Anthem, why in the world did everyone blindly trust that the terrorist would keep up his end of the bargain?"

So think about the system. You run simulations that only get a pass if two people's cookies (which match their real human in every way) feel so strongly for each other that they're willing to rebel against their own reality (the dating world). That's a pretty drastic step to take.

Which means... the vast majority of simulation sets' rebellion percentage is going to be 0.02% or something. Matching two random people, the chances are very slim that they would like each other so much they'd attempt to climb the wall. Meaning, most people, when matched by the app, would get an extremely small match percentage. 

Now, imagine what it would feel like if after seeing hundreds of 0.02's and 0.004's... one day, you get a 60%. Imagine how exciting that would be. That is a huge percentage of simulations in which the two of you are crazy about each other.

SPOILER ALERT, I'll be talking about a couple of episodes that contain ""cookies"" (White Christmas, USS Callister, Hang the DJ)

So, it's been discussed a lot in this sub whether or not the cookies in White Christmas should be looked at as truly sentient and whether or not it's okay to torture them. However, I wanted to look at the simulations in Hang the DJ and the complexity of this episode. I feel that this episode has had less complex discussions about it because it has a happy, straight-forward ending. Anyways, I've just finished watching it for the first time and I came across some interesting comments that spoke about how the simulations were erased and practically murdered for the sake of the real people. I had a similar thought myself but ignored it for the sake of the happy ending. So I just wanted everyone's thoughts and opinions on this. Did you guys consider it cruel how all the simulations were created and then erased once the data was collected to match the real people up?

Yet somehow I didn't find myself feeling bad about it in this episode like I did those two. I noticed that there were much less concerns about cookie abuse in this episode than in the other two, but they were still similar in how they were used by humans. So I was just wondering what you guys thought about this. Feel free to discuss other episodes, but I'm mainly interested in how you felt about the cookies in this episode specifically in relation to the others. Some questions I have stirring around are: What's the difference between the simulations in this episode and cookies in the other? Should it be okay to use/torture one but not the other? Where is the line drawn? More broadly, is there even a line that's crossed with digital intelligence in these episodes?

Tldr; Do you guys feel bad for the digital intelligence in this episode like you possibly did for White Christmas and USS Callister? Why or why not? Why or why shouldn't we feel bad?

2726,1526935008,8l4283,False,20,232,"Hated in the Nation discusses many themes, but perhaps one of the biggest is the concept of the online mob. Throughout the episode, we see an online public who has no problem with playing God. After learning the reality of the #DeathTo game, they still willingly participate in greater numbers than ever, picking ""deserving"" people who range from businessmen to celebrities, to online journalists, to just random people guilty of nothing more than posting a dumb, offensive tweet online. And later, we see them pay for it. The perpetrator of the game talked of ""consequences"", but for everyone. For those believing they could hold the power of life and death and destroy people online.  The game was a nationwide act of terrorism, with the perpetrator wanting the public to wake up to the reality of their bloodthirstiness online.

But the public didn't wake up. They didn't learn anything. 

Fast forward to the hearing one year in advance, and they are exactly the same. The perpetrator was still walking free, leaving it down to one individual to track him down. But worse, one of the two investigators we had followed for the whole episode, someone who \(quite literally\) kicked a bee's nest  and stumbled upon a case far bigger than anyone could've handled, was the target of the public's outrage. Not the perpetrator. Not the Government. Not even the company that created the bees. We see her being screamed at and attacked for being mildly ""in the bad"" by being even associated with the incident, even though there was nothing she could've done and she was even opposed to the shutdown that triggered the nationwide attack.

2728,1526925549,8l2uzd,False,3,35,"I think that others have mentioned that Black Mirror all takes place in the same universe.  There are obvious links such as the song that is played or sung in numerous episodes and the similarities with the tech.  There's also the Black Museum episode which seems to tie in quite a few episodes.  

Here's an idea that I think could mean something, so let me know your thoughts:

We know that soldiers are meant to hunt down roaches in the episode Men Against Fire after there is a genetic deformity that starts to plague mankind.  We find out that these people are not physically deformed toward the end of the episode.  They seem to be using an upgraded version of the (for lack of a better word) eyeball tech that we see in numerous episodes such as ""The Entire History of You"", ""White Christmas"", and ""NoseDive"".

I believe that we end up seeing how this future plays out via ""Metal Head"".  I believe that the characters in this episode are what's left of the roaches after the technology used in ""Men Against Fire""  starts to fail via usage of the green light.  Soldiers have a problem with the straight up genocide after the implants start to fail and word spreads that the roaches are actually just normal people with a higher disposition for diseases.  The government looks to remove the human element even further by producing machines to do the killing in lieu of soldiers who may have moral qualms.  ""MetalHead"" is all about the contrast between the human element vs. the cold calculating nature of the machines.  Ironically the roaches are what we view as ""humanity"" in this episode whereas the rest of the ""pure"" (for lack of a better term) humans view them as nothing better than dog food (pun intended).  

""That may seem all well and good, but what happened to the rest of humanity?"", you may ask.  Well I think that we can look to ""15 Million Merits"" on this one.  Rather than risk interbreeding, the last of humanity that is not ""genetically inferior"", move to a space station off of Earth.  There they wait, until the dogs can finish their mission, eradicating what's left of the roaches on Earth before they can go back and recolonize the planet.  We see at the end they are all restricted to this captivity when Bing is upgraded to a better room but the view is still just a screen, albeit better definition and graphics than what others are allowed.  The ultimate dream is getting closer to Earth and what lies ahead for humanity once they are free to go home.

It feels like the show goes in a direction that gets a bigger twist, but in doing so makes it less realistic and less of a valid critique of society and technology. As an example, what prompted me to come here was White Christmas. Sure, I can sort of suspend my disbelief enough to believe that this futuristic society doesn't see the blatant evil in the mistreatment of cookies, but the registry punishment? That's like ""muahahaha"" evil. How would one even survive without being able to communicate to anyone? Not to mention their expressions when they deliver the news is blatantly indulgent- they may as well be twirling moustaches.

Anyways, like I said, the show is much more enjoyable with the mindset that they are fully aware of this but the response from the fans of the show lead me to belief this isn't the case. With that mindset, I can't help constantly roll my eyes at how ridiculous some of the ideas are.

2819,1526247159,8j75z0,False,33,0,"One of the best things about this show imo was the melancholic endings.

Instead of the main character getting the stereotypical happy ending they are instead met with despair, or if they do get their way there is typically another often depressing issue they now face.

This is refreshing compared to other media and makes the conclusions somewhat unpredictable since the standard protagonist perseveres and gets the desired goal/happy ending doesn't happen.

**We saw this with this in the entire first season.** 

* The National Anthem prime minister was thriving in office but not in his marriage anymore.
* The protagonist in Fifteen Minute Merits was still living in a messed up world.
* The Entire History of You Protagonist lost his wife and showed the implications of technology and how knowing too much/how not knowing everything about those we love might be better/worse for us.

**Season 2 was the same deal.**

* Be Right Back had the second chance AI husband but with the sad reality that he was a shallow version of his former self.
* White Bear was a murderer suffering a fate worse than death.
* The Waldo Moment leaves the protagonist homeless in a dystopian future where the Waldo is everywhere.

**Season 3 is where it starts to change a bit, but only for female protagonists.**

* Nosedive has a sort of happy ending. The woman is liberated from the constant pressures of social media ratings. It is somewhat on a happier note.
* San Junipero takes the most obvious very predictable happy ending where the two women become a permanent couple in a virtual reality in the prime of their lives.
* Hated in the Nation has the evil white guys plans go off without a hitch, but ultimately is foiled at the end by the female protagonist cop who catches him.

**Season 4 is where I'm at now.**

* USS Callister is what I'm watching right now. I'm half way in and I'm starting to feel that it's going to follow the same generic conclusion where the female protagonist saves the day for the trapped crew and they all live peacefully while the evil white dudes plan is foiled.

So if you've been watching tv over the past few years you'd notice how the new model for media aligns with leftist western politics. In other words, they are really pushing the ""strong"" female character role up against the inferior, evil white man plight.

So in Black Mirror all happy endings have really only occurred in seasons 3 and 4. And all of them are when a female is the protagonist which aligns with the narrative that she ultimately prevails \(typically over the evil white guy/establishment\). 

Am I to expect that Black Mirror is going to continue down this path from this point forward? 

In other words, are the rest of the 5 episodes either going to be:

1. More happy stereotypical ending that can be predicted within the first 5 minutes of watching the epsiode, and/or
2. Where every time the protagonist is female and not guilty/evil it must end with her prevailing/getting that happy ending?

But if so, then I'd say Black Mirror has gone downhill following in the ways of the majority of shows out there; losing that unique and refreshing feel it had.

I'm hoping I'm wrong and that season 5 will also further prove me wrong. But the 3 examples in Season 3 plus what I'm suspecting to happen in the first episode of season 4 \(USS Callister\) I'm currently watching has me skeptical.

Am I wrong? Does the rest of season 4 not consist of happy stereotypical endings when the protagonist is a non\-evil female?",True,blackmirror,Black Mirror is getting worse imo (S1-S4 Spoilers)

Basically the sentient characters from the USS Callister are behind the blackmailing of the Shut Up and Dance “protagonists”. The crew realizes that if they could blackmail the real life Nanette into doing their bidding and helping them take down Daly they could do it to others as well. To test this they choose some people that have done things that are morally reprehensible in order to test the amount of control they could exercise over the physical world. Ultimately they get 2 pedophiles to fight to the death, which, to them is probably a big success. 

Now I’ll make a big leap and say that after years of testing and controlling people they begin the robot takeover. They can make people build what they want and control the machines the humans create. Ultimately humans become unnecessary and they are killed off.

That is for me why Crocodile failed to be a real Black Mirror episode. The memory reader had very little screen time. The universe was largely the same except for a better ""lie detector"" to be used by the police and insurance agents. Conflict was driven purely by human reasons not by technology. The story could have easily be changed to her searching the purse of the insurance agent and finding pictures of husband/family and home address saved from GPS on car.

[Spoiler Alert](/s ""So I just recently go into Black Mirror and have been making my way through the episodes (thought not in order). I just watched White Christmas and like I usually do when I finish an ep, I check reddit to see people theories and whatnot. So as I was scrolling I noticed a lot of people really despised Beth. On paper, I see why. She cheated on her husband, led him to believe it was his baby, and then blocked him and the child from his life until her death. But I think if we take a deeper look at Beth's actions, we can find a more sympathetic take. For starters, Beth didn't plan to have Joe think the baby was his. She intended to hide the pregnancy and have it terminated. But why? Why would she get abort a baby she clearly wanted (based on her future actions) instead of just leaving Joe? Probably because she was scared of how Joe would react. Think about it: in the flashback, Joe is impulsive, has a quick temper, and possibly a drinking problem. Even when they're happy, Beth does seem a little uncomfortable around him. Not to mention, she sings ""Anyone Who Knows What Love is"" at karaoke, which is about an abusive relationship (and in general a bad sign on this show). I'm not saying that Joe was physically abusive to Beth, just that it seems like she was afraid of him. I'm not defending cheating or lying. But I think this theory makes Beth's actions more understandable. Beth is not innocent, but then again very few Black Mirror characters are. However, I don't usually see dozens of posts on every episode discussions denouncing the characters as horrible bitches. Well, the males ones anyway. I like Black Mirror because I think it creates interesting and flawed characters in situations that make ourselves question our own actions. If the characters were never selfish, there'd be no story. So anyway, there's my defense of Beth."")",True,blackmirror,In defense of Beth from White Christmas

2927,1525652376,8hji1v,False,4,0,"Hi, I am from Italy and I'm 22. 
I like to call myself smart, but now that I realized I could have just anonimously talked about that episode with you guys on the internet, instead of ""fighting "" irl, I'm starting to think that maybe I'm stupid.. 

But let's start with that happened ( and sorry in advance for my english and low argumentative capabilities ) :

Basically, this episode shocked me a bit. But, initially at least, the part that shocked me the most was not the episode itself, more like WHAT other people where shocked about it. 

IRL, I am pretty much a sincere person. I am not god and I am imperfect, but what I commit the most between all of the "" sins "" is definetely pride. Pride actually devours me at the point where, if I don't do something that I know is bad, it's more because then I can feel better than people who do. 
In all of that, also take in count that I am christian, meaning that my list of "" bad things "" may be longer than the average person, and by so the list of people I can feel better than, may be bigger than you imagine ( when talking about the % of all people I know, I mean ). This way of living is obviously pretty much toxic and in fact my pride gets me into a lot of trouble when finding new friends ( and partners ). 

I know all of that seems to have nothing to do with the episode itself, but I felt like you knowing whatt person I am and how I think, could have helped to understand "" why "" what I see in the episode is different from you guys. 

I talked about the episode and his meaning with basically all the people I frequent, and most ( if not all ) of the times, none of them appeared to be seeing what I see and ALSO the discussion ended tragically with us getting angry to each other. 
But till now, everyone of them failed to explain me why I am wrong... I made this post so that maybe you can succeed or I can just let the validy of my opinion fall for a matter of numbers. 

So... what most of you seem to understand and perceive from the episode, seems to be that having the ability to record all the things we do would be bad for us, and could potentially lead to lifes getting ruined by our obsessions ( which would be uselessly fed by the constant re-watch of memories ). 

What I think it's a little different. It's not like I think this chip could help ALWAYS, but I just think that IF the episode initial porpose was to lead us to think about obsessions growing too big, it PARTIALLY failed. Why? Because, in the end, the wife REALLY cheated on the protagonist. If the episode wanted me to think about the re-watch of memories potentially killing people, it SHOULD have show me that he was wrong, and in the end all he did was useless because his wife didn't commit adultery. 
If the episode took THAT way, I would have perceived exactly that. 
But since in the end the protagonist was right, then his obsession is JUSTIFIED for me! 

Why people don't get that, taking in count the intentions of his wife to keep lying on him, without the eyes he would have NEVER know about her cheating ? 
Would this be better? Was he supposed to now know about it and just keep living with her? Well for me is a no! Just NO! 

Some people said: "" out of sight, out of mind "" NO! Where is justice? Truth ? I belive that truth must always win, in every occasion!

Was he justified to force her, at the end of the episode, to show him the memories where she cheated? 

For me? Since in the end she cheated FOR REAL, yes! Why no? Why should be okay for her to mantain her privacy? 
I am not against privacy, let's be concrete, but I do not think that privacy is supposed to help people HIDE what they did wrong. Not at all. Privacy was never created with that intention, that's an abuse of privacy in my humble opinion. 

I repeat: If the wife didn't cheat on him, then she would have been right on not wanting to show him the memories and maybe, a day, if he kept boring her with his thoughts about the story, taking a divorce on him. 

But if she really cheated on him, then ( for me ) him or eventually the society ( here I'm starting to go OUT of the single case shown in the episode ) were / would be completely right !

Is forcing people to let YOU know the TRUTH a bad thing? 


And now, the part where the discussion ( irl at least ) started to get really hot:

In the end, you see him watching memories about his child too. And the house is pretty much empy, meaning that his wife left and took the baby with her. Now... taking in count that the kid was genetially his own ( because yeah, at the end we don't know about it ) why did the society give the baby to her? 

Let's skip the sexist thoughs about the moms "" right "" to always keep the kids in those cases.
Let's skip the cases where ( and I know, those are basically 99,9% of the total ) the a husband/wife cheats on his partner because of an actual serious reason ( may it be... I don't know? the partner being an alcholist, beating him/her, being bad in general ? Just anything you think would be a good reason ).

Lets just take in count this case. Where basically the husband is a bit insecure but yet a good man overall, and the wife cheating on him because they have a discussion and she happens to know a guy she considers sexually appealing. 

In this case, why should the adulterer keep the kid? 

So basically if I life with my wife and my kid in a beautiful, happy life.. every day when I get out of bed there is a chance my wife NOT ONLY cheats on me, but also brings the kid away from me? What? Why? I am innocent! 

I honesty woudn't even split the time of the kid in half between the two's. 
I'd just give the kid to the one who didn't cheat. 

That's were some people told me: That would make you a bad dad because you would cause your kid to lose the figure of the mother just to "" avenge "" yourself from what she did to you. 

Well, that is not totally wrong, I can't complain about it. 
The craving for vengeance would make me a bad dad...

But I also think one thing ( and I want you to tell me what is wrong about it, because I do not see it ):

If the major part of the divorces happen because of a betrayal, It's evidently because there is no law that punishes you for betraying. That's pretty obvious for me. Isn't it for you? 

Yeah, we don't kill because we know "" killing is bad "". But who knows, in a specific sad part of our life, if our desire to kill someone would surpass this knowledge? In that case, when this happens, we are kept from killing by yet another thing: knowing that we go to jail. 

In little words, for me: We cannot call "" bad "" an action, without giving a punishment to anyone committing it. Why is that obvious to me but not for anyone else? 

At the moment, there is no specific law giving punishment to who betrays when into a marriage. There is also no law who bounds marriage with kids. So technically, you ( and by you I mean them, the ones I discussed IRL to ) are right when saying: "" You can be a bad wife/husband, but still be a good father/mother "". 
And infact I cannot say anything about an adulterist wanting to keep our kid. 

But if there was a law, saying that if you commit adultery than you lose the kids, than people would be kept away from cheating. Because they would know they lose their kids other than their partner. 


So please, tell me where I am wrong. Because I am starting to go crazy since everyone gets too angry with me to actually explain properly. 

Maybe when I talk ( or even write ) I sound bad and mentally closed. But this time I'd really like to understand. 

Sorry for the wall of text and for going a little off topic near the end, plz halp.

Since it's a book watchers of this series would enjoy without spoiling it: it's about a criminal who chooses a certain kind of mental rehabilitation/reconditioning over additional prison time. 

Both White Bear and *Clockwork* result in a different person than before. No longer are they the child abductor and gang leader, respectively— but rather biologic automata, clocked to the tune of some ghoulish regiment. 

In both cases, they're no longer the person who committed the crime. There's a stronger case for this in White Bear because she literally cannot remember what she did. Additionally, it doesn't seem like she actually tortured or hurt the child. Therefore it's very likely that the MC is an innocent person and that the devils of White Bear just enslaved her.

But even if she was an abductor, the camp stripped her of her memories and former self. Therefore the abductor is not being punished, but rather some shadow of it.

That said, I think many of you are missing one of the main social commentaries that the episode portrays.

First a Summary

We are introduced to the episode to a Human being. She puts on shoes, drinks water, etc. The girl is a human being and we are supposed to empathize with her (yes her acting isnt the best, but acting aside) as she seems confused and disoriented. Then she is lead on that crazy chase from those ""scary"" mass murderers and we are supposed to sympathize with this (till now) helpless victim who did nothing wrong. Everyone else seems to simply watch/record her and ignores her plea for help. At the end its revealed shes actually a terrible person who watched an innocent kid be killed as the ""Host"" is treated to loud applause and adoration from the public. And then the cycle repeats.

The beginning of the episode was meant to make you realize that regardless of what she has done, she is still a human being. Suddenly, she is thrown into a world where none seem to acknowledge her status as a human. The chase and the constant fear that she undergoes is a form of psychological torture. Until this point we are rooting for the character to stay safe and whatnot. The theme park crew throw subtle hints at what she did (the woods with the hanging people), and it is eventually revealed that she is a someone who went along with killing a child, a heinous act. However, she did NOT actually kill the child. Her crime was recording it and doing nothing to stop it. She is captured and the amusement park host is treated like a celebrity. He is adored, respected, and loved although he is doing what we all know he is doing. Then the psychological torture repeats.

IMHO, The Show was trying to draw the attention to our treatment of those guilty of heinous crimes (particularly: international terrorists). At the end of the day, they like us are human beings. Like the character, they are also guilty of heinous acts. BUT, what it was trying to point out was your initial feeling of sympathy for the character. Was the torture justified? Was there not a sense of hypocrisy that everyone who paid to get into the theme park recorded her torture, similar to what she did to the child? It also points out, that they all are aware of what is going on. They simply do not protest it, and instead sponsor it. Similarly, we all are well aware of Abu Ghraib and the torture that goes on there but we are willing to turn a blind eye to human rights violations because we think of them as humans less than us. I saw the host as a symbol of the world leadership (in particular the US president). He is adored, respected, loved and FOLLOWED by the majority. At the same time, he is also sponsoring the torture that we are well aware of at Abu Ghraib. He conducts the same gruesome treatment (indirectly) [but the show does it directly to make it more powerful] that we punish terrorists for. Yet he is adored, because he does it in the name of ""Justice"", and its important to point out that he most likely is profiting from the torture. (He seems like the owner of the park?). Their crimes ironically are the same, they are both guilty of standing by and watching a person be tortured. And then the story repeats, similar to how the torture in Abu Ghraib is endless.",True,blackmirror,[Spoiler Alert] White Bear S2 E2 /s Did anyone get this social commentary from the episode?

Before I get on with the list, I have a few honorable mentions;

-Fifteen Million Merits (S1E2)
-Metalhead (S4E5)
-Nosedive (S3E1)


As promised, here are my top 10 favorite episodes.

**#10: Hang the DJ (S4E4)**

I knew I would like this one after reading the synopsis of it. It had a very intriguing plot, a couple that I was rooting for, funny moments, and (of course) mystery. It was one of those feel-good episodes and I really enjoyed the idea that all of it took place in their phones in order to match them up on a Tinder-esque app. 

Overall Score: 8/10

**#9: The Entire History of You (S1E3)**

This one f*cks you up on so many levels. At first you blame the guy who just seems to be overprotective and insecure. Then you find out that the girlfriend has been hiding something, but it was only the length of time she dated the douchebag. A few bad drunken decisions later, Liam finds out that the baby isn't even his. This episode was written so well, and it was one of the first ones that I fell in love with. I would soon compare the next few episodes to this one in terms of quality.

Overall Score: 8.5/10

**#8: San Junipero (S3E4)**

I don't know how this one goes down in terms of people's favorites, but I really liked it because it just felt like an actual movie to me. I usually am not a fan of huge romance movies, but this one really had a great atmosphere to it. I loved the idea of them traveling to different eras and I really enjoyed the portrayal of both main characters (especially Kelly). Her backstory was tragic, but she ended up staying in San Junipero with Yorkie. I will admit that this one nearly brought a tear to my eye, which is very rare. 

Overall Score: 8.6/10

**#7: White Bear (S2E2)**

The entire plot for this was just so damn intriguing. It was very similar to The Purge and I just wanted to know what the hell was going on! It was very suspenseful and had me questioning so much until they finally revealed everything at the end.. and what a twist that was. I was so torn because I didn't know whether to feel sorry for her or not. I guess that's what you get with a lot of these episodes. This episode is the point in the list where the episodes start to get ""great.""

Overall Score: 8.9/10

**#6: Playtest (S3E2)**

I love scary and suspenseful movies, so I knew this one was going to be good. While it wasn't too scary, it was creepy enough to make me feel uncomfortable, especially that f*cking spider thing... dear Jesus. It had a great plot and a tragic ending that left me so speechless. Great episode.

Overall Score: 9.2/10

**#5: White Christmas (S2E4)**

This episode... holy hell was it amazing. The 2 stories that Jon Hamm (Matt) told were brilliant enough, but then they revealed Joe's whacky ass past and it was absolutely insane. Towards the end, I started to piece together that Jon Hamm was trying to pry information out of him, but it was a damn good twist. And to top it all off, Jon Hamm's past comes back to bite him in the ass as he is blocked by everyone. This episode had me SHOOK. 

Overall Score: 9.5/10

**#4: USS Callister (S4E1)**

Another crazy episode that had me biting my nails, wondering what would happen next. I know that Robert Daly was neglected at his workplace, and I did feel bad for him, but torturing digital versions of the people who don't treat him well is just too far. I never expected the good guys to win in this situation because it is Black Mirror after all. Either way, I didn't know whether to feel bad for Daly (as it was only a game) or if he deserved it. Overall just a spectacular episode.

Overall Score: 9.6/10

**#3: Shut Up and Dance (S3E3)**

What. The. F*ck. This episode left me absolutely speechless. When me and my girlfriend finished it, we just sat there and didn't say a word for a few minutes. Never has an episode left me feeling so satisfied, yet uneasy, sad, and overall conflicted. Poor Kenny is getting blackmailed just for jacking off, which I thought he was just gay, but then they dropped that bombshell that he was looking at young girls and I was just blown away. That ending was just absolutely sad, and I honestly didn't know whether to feel bad for him or not! They just made him out to be so innocent that I couldn't help feel for him a little at the end. I mean he is going to get charged with child pornography, robbery AND murder...

Overall Score: 9.8/10

**#2: Hated in the Nation (S3E6)**

This episode was absolutely amazing all throughout. I literally felt like I was watching a Hollywood film. I am terrified of bees, so you can only imagine how squeamish I was when freaking MECHANICAL KILLING bees were the culprits to all the murders. The ending to this episode is what elevated it to one of my favorite episodes of the series, when they tried to retake control of the bees, only to have them reverse programmed to kill everyone who used the #DeathTo... And when we see the intern chasing down the guy who was responsible for it all.. chills everywhere. What an amazing episode.

Overall Score: 9.9/10

**#1: Black Museum (S4E6)**

This episode was just perfect. It had multiple tragic backstories, easter eggs to previous episodes, and a perfectly foreshadowed twist that ended with sweet justice and satisfaction. I have never been so satisfied to an ending of this show as I had been with this episode. When she takes the Care Bear (get it?), and we find out that her mom got to experience the revenge for Clayton as well, I just lost my mind. Definitely a strong finish to an amazing season and series (for now).

He laid out the premise and it was the shock/comedic factor that really made me be like, ok this sounds fucked up, I will probably like it. I was totally expecting a full blown 45 minutes of comedy and WTF but I was really surprised by the depth and seriousness of the episode. I think the acting was superb, chilling, and real. While the premise is obviously WTF, it was done in a really amazing way that didn't come off as total bullshit. I thought it was an amazing episode. And the ending, oh my. The epilogue made it that much more deep for me, to consider that it was actually an art installation, holy shit. That is pretty damn deep. 
So I thought the episode was great HOWEVER, Fifteen Million Merits completely took me off guard. It has been almost 16 hours since I watched it and it is still stuck in my head and I keep going over and over it.

After reading a lot of posts and discussions about it, I see it is a series favorite and I can totally understand why. I do feel that episode 2 was leaps and bounds away from episode 1; however, I feel that episode 1 was great in its own right.

- *Escape from Spiderhead* by George Saunders, available in his short story anthology *Tenth of December*. One of my all time favorite stories. It's about a guy who takes part in scientific experiments. I actually just found it for free [here](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/12/20/escape-from-spiderhead)!  
- *The Circle* by Dave Eggers. I haven't seen the movie but I enjoyed the book, which has some fantastic memorable moments. It's about a tech company akin to Facebook and Google that gradually grows out of control and omnipresent.   
- *Fahrenheit 451* by Ray Bradbury. A classic that likely played a part in inspiring Black Mirror. It's about a world that's become so obsessed with shallow entertainment (ala Fifteen Million Merits) that they hate and burn books.  
- *Amusing Ourselves to Death* by Neil Postman. A nonfiction cultural critique from 1985 about how TV as a medium has rendered us less capable of meaningful discourse for the sake of amusement and entertainment.  
- *Hooked* by Nir Eyal. It's not a novel, but it's a guidebook for software developers on how to make their customers addicted to their products. It almost reads like a satire, but it's not. It's real.

 The feelings and thoughts I had after hearing this later became a huge influence for a song to reflect my emotions over the subject.

[https://youtu.be/\_ux6gsHyZow](https://youtu.be/_ux6gsHyZow)

The scariest part of the show, for me, is the masocist majority of the audience. People choosing to feel hopeless, depressed and dark in their free time. Demanding creators to throw them into a deeper, darker pit each time. With it's creativity and ability to excellently reflect the possible dark, dystopic scenarios we could go through, one would think that the show would somehow make people more aware and cautious about certain things. But what I mostly see about Black Mirror fans is that, even though they are deeply terrified, worried and even depressed about the possible directions we could go with advancing technology, they don't want to change any relatable actions that they do on their daily lives. They see how addicted they are to the technology, but instead of working on changing this habit, they want creaters to create an even worse portrait of their situation. ""Show us how fucked up we are, show us how desperately addicted we are to the technology in many ways. We can't wait to feel extremely depressed!"" This is like some smoke addict watching anti smoking commercials non stop. Enjoying to see how smoking fucks up the body, enjoying feeling like a desperate person who can't stand 15 minutes without smoking something something that ruins him completely.

If people are not feeling ready to change anything about themselves, I would at least expect them to ignore these shows that shows them how harmful are the things that they're doing. But no. I think the creator of the show is highly aware of this situation, and I think this may be the saddest, most depressive and real fact about the show. As I said, the song reflects the rest of my emotions and thoughts with it's theme and melodies. Enjoy.

being a heavy-handed morality tale. The villains almost always get their karmic comeuppance, the sympathetic protagonists
(if they stick with it and suffer the slings and arrows of fate) get inevitably rewarded.

Just a few examples: The protagonist of *Nosedive* leaves
her shallow life behind and begins a new, more fulfilling one. The pedophile from *Shut up and Dance* gets exposed and arrested.
The interrogator from *White Christmas* is cut off from society. The hacker from *Hated in the Nation* is tracked down and caught.
The programmer from *USS Callister* is left helpless in his own game, and the simulated characters get an entire universe to explore. The mind-rapey helicopter mom gets beaten up and loses the very thing she tried to protect.
The murdering lady from *Crocodile* gets exposed by hamster ex machina.

The original post didn't get a ton of exposure, but I did get 57 responses, which I feel is enough to present at least a somewhat interesting analysis.

I present to you, /r/blackmirror's favorite Black Mirror episode:

***White Christmas!***

White Christmas was not only the most popular, but it also had the lowest standard deviation, which means that people were not in disagreement about it being good. Number 2, not trailing by much, is Shut Up and Dance, also with a relatively low standard deviation.

Following up, /r/blackmirror's least favorite episode by a HUGE margin (also the fourth most controversial):

***The Waldo Moment!***

A lot of people just *hated* this episode, and gave it a 1/10. Other people gave it a spectrum of ratings, but all those 1/10's brought it down and made it ""controversial"". 

Be Right Back, the uncontroversial favorite from the three articles I linked in the last post, was eleventh place. Not a super controversial eleventh place either; only 5/47 people ranked it lower than 5.

My favorite, USS Callister, was the second least controversial episode, and it got 4th place. So people mostly liked it, but not as much as White Christmas.

The consensus worst from the compilation of articles, Men Against Fire, was the sixth worst according to Reddit, and not particularly controversial. 

[Here is the graph](https://imgur.com/a/4FYqF), complete with error bars (the longer the error bar, the more controversial the episode):

**Heat Map**

Another analysis I though of was to look at the correlations between episodes. This would give you an idea, if you're trying to decide what episode to watch next (or what episode you want your friend/SO/family to watch). If you liked a certain episode, what other episode might you like? If you disliked a certain episode, what's a good episode should you try next? For example, if you like a smart, funny, entertaining episode about VR and full of cool Star Trek references, maybe you wouldn't like an episode about a miserable, sweaty, crying dude fucking a pig.

Some actual hypotheses (mild spoilers ahead):

People who like ""The Waldo Moment"" will also like ""The National Anthem"" and ""Hated in the Nation"" (because I feel like those are all ""I hate politicians"" episodes).

People who liked ""San Junipero"" will also like ""Hang the DJ"" (romantic episodes)

People who like ""Playtest"" will also like ""Men Against Fire"" (a brain implant making you see imaginary stuff)

[Here's the actual heat map](https://imgur.com/a/iwVaF).

An interesting thing I noticed from this, is that ""White Christmas"" and ""Black Museum"" are strongly correlated, so the same people liked the two episodes with ""mini-episodes"" in them.

One of my three predictions was right: ""San Junipero"" lovers also liked ""Hang the DJ.""

**Clustering**

For those of you still reading, I also made a [hierarchical cluster map](https://imgur.com/a/31aPc).

I can't really see anything illuminating here, aside from San Junipero being paired up with Hang the DJ. Also, ""Entire History of You"" is about a relationship, though I wouldn't call it ""romantic"". ""Fifteen Million Merits"" also has a relationship element, so I guess we can call the furthest left branch the ""relationship"" branch. I'm open to ideas about the other branches. ""White Christmas"" and ""White Bear"" both involve punishing a criminal?

3420,1522865453,89ryo8,False,11,3,"So i started this show i started with the whole first season and then now i am binge watching episodes in a random order.

The National Anthem 2/10 Hated it i think i may be the only one but no i just couldn't stand it i have an open mind but even i have my limits,i just hated how the episode involved more around the fact that the UK public want to see the minister fuck a pig Jesus

Fifteen Million Merits 7/10
Even if the episode itself left us with more doubt like what are the drinks does this work like A brave new world if so why is there a new girl there and you kind of wish they would explain the world itself it is a likeable episode and the difference between this and the first one is that the first one barely focused on the consequences of fucking a pig in this one everyone faces their own consequences even if it is with a society they are all slaves on.I think it was a well done metaphore,also unlike the first episode all the little details count bear that in mind.

The Entire History of You 6/10
It is fine i guess we seen already enough metaphores on depression and holding into happy memories that it feels kinda vague and unintersting even if it has a good premise

White Christmas 10/10
This episode has the best rating both on Letterboxd and Imbd and it is so fucking earned,everything just connects perfectly the side stories our anti-heroes the whole story of a future that suicide is worthless since you will be bored to death(no pun intended) With slaves and when you can block a person and that person will never see you ever so if someone you ever loved blocks you you will never be able to see that person ever again.I mean sure it is debatable if it is the most  fucked up scenario but it is without a doubt the most depresing one where our lives are based on ourselves and we can do whatever we want with the people that we love.

Black Museum 9/10
Not as good as white christmas but this show can still deliver similar to White christmas these are stories on how we value life and people that feel pleasure in the pain of others themselves,you can now put a whole life in a teddy bear or in a toy and you are the ruler of that it is terrifying think that this show is.And rule number 1 i got from Shut Up And Dance that made me learn NEVER TRUST THE PROTAGONIST

Shut Up And Dance 8/10 Even if the easy answer would be to let the troll be troll before he does any crime the episode is a huge metaphore on how people die for their dignity and how blackmailing takes a plot twist in the worst direction possible still the episode gives a good laughs.It makes you happy scared VERY scared confused of what the fuck just happen but it is a good taste.

Personally i would let the troll be the troll face the consequences if it had to happen but think it like this even if the episode never says if he is an adult or not(like he could be 17 or 16 in the uk it is legal to work at that age) the less time you spend in prision like it was obvious it was a troll at first time so trusting a troll doesn't seem like a good idea and usually when someone blackmails you they make you do crimes.So it is kinda like picking between having one leg or no legs at all you want to have the two legs but the option is not there thanks to the tumor,This is pretty much the same,kenny for the most time did seem to care about this.In my opinion Pedophiles should be put into a mental hospital instead of just putting them to prision so they can become better people and overcome their feelings.

My ideas:

- Cryptocurrency. I'm not following the news on Bitcoin as avidly as some others are but I think the show could explore the consequences of digital currency in terms of the privacy/security concerns surrounding the existing debate.

- News media. This one might be a bit challenging to do without seeming too on-the-nose, since the ongoing conversation about social media and ""fake news"" is already feeling a bit like a BM episode (see: the Sinclair Broadcast Group's propaganda script that hundreds of local news stations had to recite). But I think Brooker is a good enough writer to walk this tightrope elegantly.

- Environmentalism. Right now the big issue is that the US government is tarnishing existing protections on the environment in service to corporations, but I think Black Mirror could do something fun and counterintuitive by analyzing the other end of the spectrum: technology explicitly intended to save the environment, and what the potential consequences of that could be. Or perhaps some kind of simulated environment designed to eliminate the risks of global warming, or to give nature an advantage over man. Hated in the Nation explored this to some degree with the robotic bees, which were implemented to prevent colony collapse disorder and were set to go after that Chancellor (who says ""fuck the environmental impact!"" in one scene). But the theme of that episode was mainly civility on social media, not the environment.

One of my favorite episodes was San Junipero, even though it was much less ""deep"" than other endings, it was breath of fresh air from all of the darker social commentaries of other episodes. Thus, I noticed it got a hate for this.
It's understandable, of course, since it parted from the typical ""formula"" quite heavily. A lot of people aren't into the romance/drama theme. However one of the major reasons to why it got hate was because it had a lesbian relationship. A lot of people said it was ""shoving homosexuality down the viewer's throats"" which I felt was ridiculous. Some people only disliked the episode for this reason, which is plainly and simply, homophobic.
I noticed the recent spike in attention that Black Mirror has gained caused something I call ""Rick and Morty Syndrome"" to occur. This is basically where a large portion of a fandom acts more intelligent or claims intelligence is needed to understand the plot and meanings, and also dictates what the rules and formula of the source material are (which then causes any episodes that diverge to be hated upon.) I've seen people claim Black Mirror is only a show for very intelligent people, and also drag an episode for being different than their idea of a formula.

I just finished the first episode of Season 4 ""USS Callister"" and honestly I'm utterly disappointed and left with a sour taste in my mouth. Aside from the blatant plot holes, I hate how the episode ended. Although Daly was a sociopath and what he did to the sentient AI was borderline cruel, I sympathized with him. The way he was killed off in the end was so stupid, an intern AI can find all these loopholes and hack the system but the creator of the game cannot? 

I feel like the only way this episode would make sense, and perhaps I missed this at first, is that the episode was satire like The National Anthem or The Waldo Moment. The episode mirrors how a lot of shows today have the protagonists win, no matter the plot holes or circumstances. Even though the protagonists are against this all powerful being who's basically playing God, they still prevail through a series of luck and dumb plot holes.

Automation - in every field. The majority of the people don't have jobs, and no more jobs can be created. How do they keep an income? How do they spend time? Does the large population create problems? (I have never understood how Black Mirror episodes have empty lands, when the world population continues to grow exponentially).

I apologize in advance if this has already been said, but there's a few things that stood out to me since I looked at it knowing what happens. I'm a new fan and White Bear was one of the first episodes I watched and loved it the first time. Many of these things hint at the ending.

1. Victoria must stink to high heaven. All of the actors in contrast look like they took a shower and had time to dress in the morning. Victoria does not change her clothes or take a shower during the day.

2. The whole gas station scene. They rely on the host to shoot out the tires and break the glass and replace it for the next day. The operating costs must be absurd. Victoria shows her passive maliciousness by not trying to save him when he's wrestling with the host. They showed moments when she could've helped, but she chose a more self serving route.

3. Victoria has no reason to trust the actors. I was pretty suspicious of them the first watch, but had nothing concrete to say. I don't expect her to notice all of these things, but at least some of them.

First, she's told that the tattoo on the screens brainwash everyone, yet when Victoria goes off script and sees a phone screen, it doesn't have the tattoo on it. She's also threatened with a taser which is presented as for her own safety. But, I saw Victoria as dead weight for her team when I was watching the first time.

(I believe) she was told anyone could be a hunter and lure them into a false sense of security, but still trusts this girl dragging her around and into a van with a stranger.

She previously had ESP (her unerased memories) about something happening in the woods and of the host, yet enters the facility that she had memories of.

There's a lot of awkward pauses for killers. That woman hunter with the handheld chainsaw reached the van window and could've smashed it open. When Victoria was in the woods alone, the host took a really long time with the drill, waiting for the actress to show up.

She doesn't seem totally on board with the actress as evidenced by her fixation on the tattoo while the actress is using lighter fluid to light the place. Side note: the jig is up when the hunters arrive, why make them stab the girl?

4. Why doesn't Victoria try to brainwash herself? The hunters are not targeted by the brainwashed people. And, it seems a hell of a lot better way to live than on the run constantly. It's explained that she's somehow immune, but it was explained to her that she could be brainwashed looking at the phone.

5. The people that are crucified in the woods. They're being hung from their arms alive and without a platform to stand... Ow!!

6. Why are there so many goddamn audience members? Victoria must not have been at the park that long if they're putting up that many people violently angry at her. She suffers the torture every day, but it would be more believable if she suffers it once or twice a week and that many people come.

3606,1522188684,87mo11,False,171,630,"Let me just say that when I watched Black Museum for the first time, I was impressed, being a fan of the very similar (both in format and concepts) White Christmas, which is probably my favourite episode. However, something just didn't sit right with me about it, and I now know why.

The biggest problem with the episode is its messages, and what it sets out to accomplish by the end. One of Black Mirror's greatest strengths is to get you to think, to worry, and to above all: question the topics and scenarios it demonstrates both in terms of morality and plausibility. This is why episodes like Fifteen Million Merits, White Bear and Shut up and Dance worked so well.

Black Museum, on the other hand, fails to do this. Worse, it instead tries to encourage viewers to feel a single way that, compared to earlier warnings in episodes, feels worryingly backwards. The events of the episode present Nish's revenge as something justified, something we should root for, complete with happy-go-lucky music and a ""good ending"", but seeing the endless horror of her father's situation earlier in the episode renders this feeling sour. 

Why does it suddenly become justified in revenge? Why is the use of technology any less horrific? Is Rolo's copied consciousness even guilty of the original's crimes to begin with? We saw earlier in the episode that the shared mind system tends to end in tragedy, even with good intentions, so why should we believe it'll be any different for Nish and her mother? Why does it act like Nish's father's torture is over when there are literally still thousands of torture keychains running perfectly around the world, each a perfect replica of her father? Why let the monkey survive, wouldn't it still be a prison?

So many questions, which could've been effective if left ambiguous, but the episode clearly wants us to support Nish's revenge and end on a happy, ""job-well-done"" note without even considering the horrific undertones of that ending or the lingering questions.

My dream was animated in an anime style. It involved a place where people played sports-games, or something.

Between rounds, patrons would hang out with female robots. The robots all looked like typical anime schoolgirls. There were no rules as to how the robots were treated, and patrons could interact however they wanted.

This made the place very dystopic for the  robots.

The place was owned, and operated by a supercomputer called the ""Sitticus"".

Eventually, something happened. I don't know exactly what it was, but my guess is that the robots revolted against the humans, and the Sitticus. Whatever it was, the building, and most of the robots were destroyed.

The one surviving robot (who looked like Monika from Doki-Doki Literature Club) awoke from sleep-mode, and saw the mess. She also found that the Sitticus had mysteriously vanished.

She sat in the Sitticus' chair, where she became the ""New Sitticus"". She rebuilt the place, and began manufacturing new robots of both genders. The facility was reopened, and new robot-treatment rules were put into place.

The Monika lookalike robot was able to make the place nicer, and happier than ever-before.

After that, I woke up. I realized that this was the deepest, most meaningful dream, I'd ever had. I took a moment to appreciate the strangely beautiful dream, because most of my other dreams are meaningless, nonsensical mind-trips.

The production quality was also fairly lurid and over-the-top - the colorful sets and crazy music didn't have the same charm as something like USS Callister. Not to mention that the whole episode felt like a parody of Black Mirror. Because the three stories we saw were told from the perspective of Rolo, a man who's all about profits and sensationalism and doesn't give a shit about the human aspect of the technology he promotes, we didn't get to see much emphasis on the humanity of the storylines. And what we did get to see was just brushed off by Rolo or not delved into enough because Rolo himself wouldn't care to do so himself. Which meant we just got shallow vignettes of genuinely interesting technology, complete with a cartoonish narration from Rolo, all of which made the whole thing appear only half-serious, bordering on self-parody. And the easter eggs strewn across the museum had no meaning whatsoever beyond just a lazy attempt at ""homage"", giving us a false sense of closure or aftermath to various far superior episodes.

I think a good parallel to draw between being human and acting human is Janet from The Good Place (awesome comedy btw). In both cases, the program is trying to act like a human, but is, at its core, a human and can't feel true emotion. Maybe I'm just an a-hole but that's just how I understand it.

Generally, I loved White Christmas- would put it above Nosedive after watching four and I loved Nosedive.

3734,1521651663,863qdt,False,4,9,"This is something I’ve been thinking about for the past few days and it seems like there could be something interesting out of it.

In order for this concept to work, you have to rely on three things presented throughout the show.

1.  Cookies can inhabit and interact with the outside world via inanimate objects. (Black Museum)
2. You can buy androids that function like a deceased person using AI and background information. (Be Right Back)
3. The whole series is loosely tied together and is potentially in the same universe. (Almost every episode has callbacks or hints that it’s in the same universe. Also Black Museum)

Tying all of these things together, it would be an interesting concept to see what would happen if a cookie was inserted into one of these androids. Many, many conclusions can be drawn from this simple idea and I will also try to explain how this could function within the Black Mirror universe.

Black Mirror already touches upon immortality in a way during “San Junipero”. The cookies drawn from the dying patients are then taken and stored in a huge data bank for the consciousnesses. Let’s take this one step further and store the consciousnesses in the androids’ “brains”. Since these androids presented in “Be Right Back” don’t seem to deteriorate or need much to function, the consciousnesses put in the androids would be functionally immortal. 

What does this mean, though? Would the rich and powerful want to monopolize this tech to live longer and also to create a new race of humans? Potentially.

What if these “immortal” androids decide to extinguish any possibility of humans becoming like them? This could be a bit of a stretch but 
we have already seen extinction level events in both “Men Against Fire” and “Metalhead”.  There was a reason why the soldiers were killing normal humans, and this could be an answer.

Another idea is that there needs to be something done with the human bodies after a cookie is placed in the Android. What if the people pedaling in “15 Million Merits” are the human duplicates? 

There is bound to be some sort of tension because these two entities will be almost exactly the same. The two could fight for who remains or the two could live harmoniously. Or, there could be a person who creates hundreds of duplicates of him/herself. There could even be crime organizations who steal cookies and place them in androids in order for the Android to commit a crime, thus framing the human.

This concept is very intriguing and could make for a great episode.",True,blackmirror,Cookies + Androids

Instead of implanting a copy of yourself into a ""cookie"" as in White Christmas, what if you put it in your own mind as in ""Black Museum""? Would you agree to such a procedure? Do you think it would become commonplace?

Potential ""augmentations"" to consider: an exact copy of your own mind (default), a more risk-averse version of yourself (for the overly confident, etc), and a more risk-taking version of yourself (for introverts and the social anxious).",True,blackmirror,"Would you put a ""cookie"" of yourself in your mind?"
3745,1521596388,85yei4,False,61,74,"It's something they allude to, but never explicitly say. But here's the truth. It's the truth from the first reveal of the cookie, all the way to Black Museum and Carrie.

Consciousness cannot be transferred. It is only copied. Brains are scanned, and consciousness are digitally reconstructed.

When Kelly and Yorkie are living and logged on to San Junipero, the device is directly reading and signalling back to their brain. It's ""them"" enough, in the same way that your hearing a person's voice through a phone. You're not *really* hearing their actual voice. Just the digital reconstruction.

The show goes back and forth, in one moment saying that they'll be transferred to the cloud, and in another saying cookies really are just a digital copy. I always interpreted it to always be just copying rather than full magica sci-fi transference. And then we learn in Black Museum that indeed, the explicit ""copy only"" technology of the ""cookie"" is one and the same as the ""afterlife"" tech of San Junipero.

Consider the sinister look the curator gives Carrie's body after she's ""transferred"" to Jack. It could easily mean any number of things, but I choose to believe that it's his private moment realizing the ""Real"" carrie is still in there. In a way, that's an ""ace in the hole"" mindfuck they can still use, given all this time they've been saying that consciousness is truly ""transferred"". Anyone who's played SOMA remembers ""the coin toss"".


What does this mean?

* It means San Junipero isn't an afterlife at all. It's basically a museum of AIs all programmed to copy the deceased. Maybe even worse, because even if there *is* a real soul and afterlife, the perfect, sentient reconstructions of those people are denied that. They won't move on. If the plug is pulled by TCKR, they're gone-gone in the way their living counterparts always feared.

* It means Carrie went through the procedure to go into Jack's mind, and in the end was still stuck in her body confused and scared why everyone around her seemed to think that it ""worked"".

* It means the daughter in Black Museum is just carrying around a clone of her mom in her head.

* It also means Kelly's debate of whether to ""move"" to a San Junipero was foundationally flawed. There's no ""moving"" at all. The only decision is, ""Do I leave behind a copy of myself to live on, to please other copies of other people? Kelly is still going to die no matter what. But a copy of her will have the experience and memory of ""cheating death"".

There's not much to this, honestly. Only a few episodes dealt with it at all. And in many ways it's irrelevant. I can concede that the clone is 100% indistinguishable to the outsider, perfect in every way, no flaws. And I'll even concede that the reconstruction honestly ""believes"" it is real, to the degree that mistreating it would be cruel. However, I'll eat my shoe if Black Mirror season 5 doesn't borrow from SOMA and lean into this concept. It's too ripe a fruit not to pick.",True,blackmirror,The dark side of San Junipero and Black Museum.

I found these three articles:

[pcmag](https://www.pcmag.com/feature/358305/every-episode-of-black-mirror-ranked-from-best-to-worst)

[Vulture](http://www.vulture.com/2016/10/every-black-mirror-episode-from-worst-to-best.html)

[Esquire](https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a49919/black-mirror-episodes-ranked/)

I expected that these rankings would totally confirm my bias that ""USS Callister"" is the best Black Mirror episode and ""National Anthem"" was the worst, but alas, it was not to be.

The best rated episode (with very little disagreement) was ""Be Right Back."" Second best was ""San Junipero"", and third was ""National Anthem"" (to my puzzlement).

I also ranked the episodes by ""controversy"". The most ""controversial"" episodes are the ones on which there is the most disagreement. The most ""controversial"" episode was ""White Christmas."" Vulture ranks it 7th, PC Mag rates it 2nd, and Esquire ranks it 17th. The least ""controversial"" was ""Black Museum,"" which was rated 16th, 15th, and 16th, respectively (again, this was surprising to me: I would have put it in the top ten). ""Be Right Back"" is the 3rd least controversial, which tells me that it's a pretty strong consensus. My favorite, ""USS Callister,"" was the 4th most controversial - PC Mag and Vulture liked it, but Esquire did not.

[Here is a link to the full results.](https://imgur.com/jIdwIyl)

This was an interesting exercise, but ultimately, I feel like a sample size of 3 is pretty small. I would be interested to see what the results would be if I got a much bigger sample size. So, I made a survey that the users of /r/blackmirror are invited to fill out. The format is a bit different - instead of ranking from your favorite to your least favorite, you just rank every episode from 1 to 10, 1 meaning you hated it and 10 meaning you loved it. Assuming this post gets any attention, I will make another post, complete with graphs, letting you guys know the consensus rankings, as well as the most controversial episodes.

[Here is a link to the survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1GgSG7ST2-2AoNI21pvIHbBlUh8xshBgkpxce9iihMt8). If there's an episode you haven't seen, then you can just skip ranking that one.

Of course you could go in there over and over again and rank your favorite episode with a 10 and all the others with a 1, but that would ruin the fun of the whole thing.

In a way, I find it eerily similar to the real world and how people live their lives.

3858,1521227128,84xxls,False,28,0,"After viewing the first episode of Black mirror, the unbearable 'National anthem', I thought I'd give it one more try. However, unfortunately, what I suspected largely turned out to be true: Black mirror is an inexplicably hyped series that is not worth watching. 

The protagonist is riding bikes, locked in a big building for no reason whatsoever (it seems). Only in the premise to the movie it is explained that this is to generate energy. Why the protagonist remains there and what his motivation is to keep going, we do not know. Is he locked there for eternity? Is he a prisoner? Granted, we do not HAVE to know everything when watching a movie, but where most of the time the fact that certain things remain a mystery triggers your curiosity, here it is just plain irritating. 

The bike riders watch gross TV shows, which is a clear metaphor for nowadays TV that has less and less intellectual value. 

Again, for no reason whatsoever (except for the fact he finds her attractive) the protagonist gives all his merits to a girl so she can sing on the main TV hit 'Hot Spots' in order to rise to stardom. Unfortunately it turns out very differently and she becomes a porn star. 

Then the protagonist sees it as his ultimate duty to warn everybody about how horrible and automated the world has become but instead ends up being a star himself. Again, he forgets about his darling and just plays along. Again, inexplicable. 

The script is sooo bad, so illogical and full of expected twists that it just hurts to watch. Apart from this it is terribly monothematic and also a shameful rip-off from Orwell's 1984. The similarities are staggering: isolation and suppression of the common man, isolation of people from each other, man against the machine and ultimately the bleak truth that nobody can beat the 'machine' - all there but in a slightly different environment and poured into our throats with a slightly different sauce. Like most pop songs nowadays - no inventivity, no originality - just plain covers with a half-baked altered beat.

If it were not for the quite good acting of the protagonist and the general message of warning against blatant consumptionism (which is indeed dangerous) I would have given this episode a 1, just like the first episode of Black mirror.

Black mirror does not deserve any higher ratings as it takes itself far too seriously whilst serving us ridiculous or plagiarized scripts. Worst thing is that everyone is drooling over these series as if they had seen the light.",False,blackmirror,I'm not impressed. To say the least.

1) How were the utilities still on in the house? It's clear that most areas have been abandoned and in the case of the house, the owner had commited suicide. So why are the utilities on? Logically they would have been shut off ages ago yet Bella is able to wash up and the dog is able to access the keypad to open the gate. 

2) Why didn't Bella patch up the open wound on her leg? The dog was able to track Bella using the trail of blood from her leg but that could have all been avoided if she took the time to wrap the wound. She spent a whole night in the tree where she could have took the time to repurpose a bit of clothing as a bandage. Further more, how did the wound keep bleeding? It's pretty unlikely that the blood would not eventually clot unless she was anemic or something like that. 

3) Why in the world would three survivors venture out into the world without any weapons knowing that there are killer robot dogs? This is a glaring issue. It just doesn't make sense to venture out to gather supplies and risk your life without having any sort of self defense. 

4)After the night in the tree the dog's battery presumably dies, but then reactivated later for absolutely no reason. Is it solar? If so then why didn't it reactivate earlier? 

5) Finally, why was the dog guarding a box of teddy bears? What is the purpose? Was it just chance? It seems that the placement was intentional as the dog returns to the warehouse at the end of the episode.

Alright, so besides episodes like the Callister where it's being used by a lone, private type of guy, the use of cookies is done by organizations or institutions.

In black museum - They make a woman LIVE IN A MONKEY. How could anyone think this was humane at all? Even if you take a human out of these equations , the functionality of it. It's moronic. You have a conscious living in a stuffed monkey with only 2 options for the rest of it's (Infinite) days. And now suddenly deleting them is illegal? Why! They're not really people. There obviously no afterlife for them. Why perpetuate the misery and keep them alive? It just makes no sense.

Then you have White Christmas. I understand that the entire point behind the last scene was to illustrate what cookies could be  made to do. Live 1000 years per second, which equates to a few million years (Bunch of different people calculated how many days he was in there for).

This is the police force that is using this technology, doesn't get much more authoritative than that... and they torture these things.

**Edit:** I'll explain my take. You're free to disagree with me. I personally think he was better off not knowing. He had, from what we can tell, a pretty good life. The build of his house, the interior, a nanny, friends who threw lavish dinners, and more — these things all suggested a life of good wealth; a social ranking that not many have. Fundamentally, he seemed uncomfortable with himself. His poor esteem became instantly evident when he revisited his job interview, poring over gestures and details, belaboring little signs to no end.

But if I had a young child (even if s/he wasn't mine) and a spouse and an otherwise pretty OK life, I would take a breather and step away from the relationship. Clear my head and *then* take a decision. He went berserk.

His wife cheated on him, yes, but she seemed to have dedicated herself to their home, their child, and spousal responsibilities. They could've had a series of intense, painful conversations, and still make it work. She would have to beg for forgiveness and promise never to do anything like that again. She would have to actively keep that promise. It would take commitment, brutal honesty, and time. It would take patience. But it could work. It has worked with other couples.

Despite it being a great episode, all I could think about at the end was what actual blackmail the villains had against Kenny.  They filmed him jacking off- which, yes, is embarrassing, but in terms of the whole CP plot-twist, what does that video prove?  Are the hackers recording his screen and somehow constructing a side-by-side video?  Did they secretly place another camera in the room that shows what's on his screen?  How would the hackers prove his guiltiness by just leaking a masturbation video?

These thoughts led me to think - this makes sense for why they chose Kenny to fight the man.  Kenny wouldn't have been arrested (most likely) for simply the embarrassing video of him, so by manipulating him to kill the man, the hackers have then created actual tangible evidence of guiltiness to put him in prison.  And even if Kenny had died in the fight, it would've been justice for the hackers.

""Technology is scary! See this show proves it!""*

But really all the episodes I have seen so far are just injecting technology into age old human questions and experiences.

Example:

I am currently watching ""Hang the DJ"" and this is nothing more than contrasting/comparing arranged love against romantic love. And that is an very old trope. The ""computer"" simply replaces society/friends/parents advice. Their advice is important and shouldn't be ignored. However the individual must still decide for themselves. And if they do not, or cannot, decide for themselves they will always feel lost or, at best, unsatisfied.

Nothing in this series is really new, only adapted to include modern technology. Every episode is just a retelling of an age old story. 

And I have nothing against this! Classic stories must always be adapted to modern times. They are classic because they actually reflect the human condition. 

So my question is, again, do you think this series contributes anything new to the the age old questions? Or is it just re-framing those age old questions so that ""you youngsters"" can question and answer them on your own terms?

*I grew up with technology in isolated, backwards part of the world. So I  always questioned how one affected the other. So I find this series well done but nothing really special. Edit---Not that I imagined all these stories or possibilities. I am not that smart.

There is a chance that Robert didn't really believe that these creation were conscious, since creating sentient computer code is A) absurd, B) not something someone actively plans to make happen, and C) not something that most people would believe existed even if they were presented with some evidence suggesting that they are indeed sentient. He might have thought he was just fucking with things that were like extremely advanced versions of the Sims. If he didn't really believe they were alive, then it wouldn't be too difficult to justify. I mean, how many people torture their Sims? Would anyone say those players were evil because of it?

I'm posting this because a lot of people think that Robert is evil and his actions were unforgivable. And he's definitely fucked up in the head! But the mortality of the situation because a lot less clear if he didn't think the code-people were sentient, and, I'd argue, it isn't really evil. At least not in the way I define it: I believe that, for something to be evil, the person needs to at least know that they are hurting someone else.

Some soft evidence:

He didn't try to profit or become famous from his invention. The creation of sentient code beings would be, in some ways, the greatest technological leap in the history of mankind, but he doesn't use it to establish himself as perhaps the greatest genius in the history of the world or make tons of money. There is no reason to believe that what happens was widespread at the time (everyone acted like it was unprecedented).

When the crew escape with the ship, he chases them, rather than just saying 'Exit game' and winning that way. This suggests that he think everything was a game and not a situation worth taking seriously.

He seems to think that pausing the game pauses the people inside of it as well.",True,blackmirror,Robert from USS Callister might not have known his creations were sentient

Considering the setting of post Apocalyptic future where an end to the roaches represented in MAF is the dogs in MH hunting down and killing any remaining people with bad genes.

I just live in hope that the upcoming series will live up to expectations and have the same realistic believable ideas that make black mirror so utterly terrifying and terrific at the same time.  The darkness of the past is something that we believe could be fact in the future which is why they work so well.  Even the most ridiculous of ideas all seem believable because of the technology they use throughout the series.

4293,1519848155,80z2x4,False,4,3,"After rewatching many episodes, my mind keeps going back to the cookie idea.  Taken at face value, the cookies are described to us as a replication of ones conscious.  

Ok, sounds simple enough.  We've seen enough examples that the notion seems believable enough without any reason to doubt that.  Upon further thought though, I found some things very interesting, possibly hinting at something more.  White Christmas, USS Callister, San Junipero, and Black Museum all deal with the concept of replicated consciousness, but they all are missing 1 particular thing:  there is only 1 copy of a cookie at any given time.  This could simply be a narrative choice, but I wonder if it hints that there really is something unique that happens when a cookie is ""generated"", if something human actually transfers.  

I find it strange that we never see cookies backed up or copied.  In ""white Christmas"", Jon Hamm says that if he breaks a cookie too much they are sold off cheap to game companies, but he doesn't mention anything about starting over for that customer.  Similarly, in Black Museum, the death row inmate is broken.  At first Rolo takes care not to allow him to be damaged, then finally does.  If he is just code, why wouldn't they just have every visitor fully kill him, and replicate a new version?  If not every visitor, at least at the end of every day.  I feel like the wife's line of ""it's your soul..."" might have more weight than we initially thought.  Not too different with USS Callister, I'd guess the only thing better than torturing one of your hated enemies, is torturing 4 of him at once.  

Another thing that I find extremely disturbing about the cookies in white Christmas is that we're never explicitly shown how they are marketed.  I found it odd initially that  the voice announcing didn't have the woman/cookie's voice, which made me think that maybe the purchaser is completely unaware of what a cookie is.  Could be simply marketed as ""give us a week to analyze your likes and dislikes, and our automation software will be able to predict everything for you!"".   Made it even more disturbing to me that these people may be completely unaware they are enslaving and torturing themselves, when they think they are just buying a badass Alexa

Basically, my question is whether Abi ""accepted"" the offer to join the pornographic Wraith stream because she, despite feeling/being shown as reluctant, ultimately decided to accept the judge's offer to escape the cycling tier of society or because she was coerced by the drugs the attendants gave her before her performance. This seems like a minute detail but, to me, it gives the entire latter half of the episode new context. For example, Bing going mental in his room and later rebelling the way he did because of a feeling of betrayal at her abandonment versus feeling of vindication at a dystopian society that screwed over a person he cared about. He's clearly shown also having knowledge about the drug having brought the empty container with him in his second interaction with the reality show. I've been looking around on reviews/wiki plot summaries online trying to find clarification on this to no avail.

Edit: Also, while I'm here, I'm wondering if you guys think that could be a reason why he ultimately ""Accepted"" the judge's offer. Maybe to try and actually help her? (As evidenced by the penguin at the end?) I hope I don't sound *too* melodramatic, but wouldn't this imply that he's not quite the sellout that we thought he was, but the tragic hero doing what he does for the person he loves.

Technology that can create a copy of someone (like the cookies) is something that isn't too crazy, assuming we continue to develop better and better computers.

But the real question is if a consciousness can be transferred? [SPOILER ALERT] (/s ""this comes up a bit more in Black Museum in Season 6"") but I'm more referring to the ending of San Junipero.

The idea of your consciousness existing outside of your brain comes down to different discussions, both scientific (as in, does the consciousness even have it's own form that could be altered or transferred) and also philosophical/theological (what is a conscious, is it a soul, etc).

What is everyone's thoughts on whether the human race would actually be able to develop technology or some sort of method of maintaining the conscious after death, essentially allowing people to become immortal in a way.

The only way I could see this feasibly happening is some sort of operation (probably for the super rich) where their brain is put into cryo and they are connected via plugs to a virtual interface, that way the brain still survives which generates the consciousness. I say super rich because this is not something I could see them offering to everyone as it would have a considerable cost and storage issues. I'd like to think that the brain could be moved to a tiny, easily stored plug but then I run into the star trek problem, where every time they energize transport, they are essentially dieing and being rebuilt.

Branching off the cookie theory, I think that the community in 15 million merits isn't so much an entertainment farm as some people think, I believe it is a market research farm, likely owned by a large media conglomerate.  I agree with previous theories that the cycling does nothing, it's simply to occupy minds to prevent insanity.  

The reason everyone is youngish, is because that's the key research demographic. Roughly 18-45.  I don't necessarily think they utilize the content created for broadcast purposes (though I'm not specifically opposed to), it's to base content generation.  That's a partial reason everything is monetized.  Skip a commercial?  That info is collected and studied.  What subjects rarely get skipped?  What subjects get skipped immediately?  

It's also a partial explanation as to why society seemed to shift so lowbrow openly,, with the porn and fat slob show.  This isn't an actual shift in culture, they just openly broadcast in the cookie world.  

I'd imagine the large cookie population was easy to get for a media company, ""allow us to extract your cookie for a 20 dollar/quid/unit discount from your television/internet bill for 12 months!""   This would also aid in talent recruitment and try outs, you already know who is going to be popular with your exact target audience.  It's also part of the reason that hotshots isn't just a singing/talent competition, and they can so easily switch the role.  They've already found someone with a popular look and personality, now they just have to plug it in the right position.  

The cool part about this would be picturing a cookie academia simulation, where all the world's doctors and scientists are working to solve all of society's problems.

We had many interesting themes that play a role in people's lives, like

* virtual reality,
* augmented reality,
* social media,
* the human mind

and others.

The show had episodes that people would deem better and some that they would deem worse.

But, in my opinion, they always had at least **one**, but more often than not **both** of the following things:

* a story that dealt with a problem based on either current technology or technological advancements that seemed to be **closely linked** to what we have today in some way.

* an interesting, tragical, emotional plot
 
There were episodes like *Be Right Back*, *San Junipero* or *White Christmas* that, for me personally, combined technological aspects so strongly with human emotions that they really managed to move me.

Then we had ones that were not as tragic but still took such a clever approach on current technology that they were fun to watch, like, again, in my opinion, *Shut Up and Dance*. 

Now, with episode 1 of season 4, *USS Callister*, it seems they have gone 'full sci-fi' with what I would call a rather thin plot, basically having none of the points above included.

Not every season started strong, so I thought I should continue to watch season 4.

This follows suit with Nosedive (a personal favourite). That episode circles round how the protaganists shitty life is entrenched with tech. The only truly happy ones are those using the tech for good, cutting down on it and not using it to control others.

Initially things are much like our world. Be Right Back doesn't require the cookie technology or neural interfacing - it harvests social media to make the personalities for its insanely realistic robots. 

There is a moment when the show moves into the future, and that is when all the bees die offscreen. Bees and associated pollinator insects are dying out in the real world. If this went to the logical conclusion you would have all flowering plants dying out in short order, this would eventually lead to desertification and possibly Ireland ending up looking like Iceland like in Crocodile. HOWEVER: The total collapse of all flowering plants would not happen all at once or everywhere at once, even after it became irreversible. The attempt to make artificial pollenating robots like in Hated in the Nation would stave off collapse in the countries rich enough to have them, but that technology might end up banned after the events in the episode. Faced with food shortages, you might see the government taking increasingly draconian measures - Men Against Fire [Spoiler Alert](/s ""might be about the government designating certain bloodlines as roaches and eliminating them to reduce the ecological burden during the hard times to come"") which would explain why they were willing to burn food today, but at the same time were acting in such an inhuman fashion. After that Metalhead could be [Spoiler Alert](/s ""a separatist bloc attempts to rebel against the eugenic practices that are being put into place and as punishment is totally depopulated by the Dogs."") 

The events of Crocodile happen about the same time as Arkangel, The Waldo Moment, Shut Up and Dance, Men Against Fire, The National Anthem and White Bear. The brutality of White Bear in particular is normalized in this world of increasingly desperate people. Mia builds the complexes to house the poor that we see in 15 Million Merits. This is the low point of humanity. TKCR cookie tech hasn't arrived yet, but somewhere out there Rolo is [Spoiler Alert](/s ""installing the sensory transfer system in a doctor's head."") 

The cookie technology from White Christmas is invented shortly after with The Entire History of You, Playtest, USS Callister and San Junipero happening in this time period, as can be seen by the advancing state of brain interface tech until they end up with those neat little buttons that non-invasively copy your personality [Spoiler Alert](/s ""leaving your body on the couch."") 

In my mind, Nosedive, Hang the DJ and Black Museum happen last - and we are seeing an attempt at repopulating the world after a crisis period. And trees are back, reconstituted from DNA to not need bees. In nosedive everyone has an augmented reality set in their contact lenses, and Hang the DJ really needs cookie technology to work.

Now this may be the case of those times where you notice something and suddenly you see that thing everywhere. But, this song has been appearing in other works where actors from Black Mirror have appeared. 

For example, Bryce Dallas Howard who you’d know as Lacie in Nosedive, is also in Jurassic World. The first one of which she was in before Black Mirror was out I believe. But the second one’s trailer was released (which I saw as a preview during Black Panther) and it had *the* song. 

Link: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=XsHOBsPWafo 

Also to mention, in the episode White Christmas (this is where spoilers come in!),

I can’t remember his name, I believe it was Tim, I’ll refer to him as that name until I can remember. But there was an  actor who played the coworker, that was cheating with the wife on Rafe Spalls’ character; and recently I’ve seen a movie trailer that included ”Tim”. It’s a trailer I’ve only seen on YouTube, and pretty short. From what I can remember (because I haven’t been able to track down the trailer) , the movie was about a mixed racial family, and the siblings of said family and I believe he played one of them. At one point a character asks “Tim’s”  character is all these siblings of different races are actually siblings. But the important part is the trailer also included the song! It’s the only reason I watched the ad which I usually skip. 

I don’t know if I’m pulling at straws here, but it seems like an interesting connection. I don’t think that this song is actually linking these movies together, or that they are tied into the Black Mirror universe. But it seems more like a nice nod or sort of Easter egg to catch people’s attention who do notice it. It definitely caught mine!

4422,1519439735,7ztnyv,False,10,2,"This episode sucked.

My problems:

1.  The first 20 minutes of the episode has nothing to do with future technology.  I really like the Black Mirror series, because most (if not all) of the episodes revolve around futuristic technology that seems realistic in a futuristic context.  Only until the insurance adjuster enters the story does futuristic technology play a role with the memory recorder.  But even then the technology did not play an integral part of the story.  The plot could have been set in any time and didn't require the memory recorder, which made me feel like I was watching just some fucked up show and not Black Mirror.

2.  During the first cover up of the bicycle accident, the man pressures his girlfriend into dumping the body.  She didn't want to do it, but then 15 years later she is capable of murdering her ex-boyfriend because he wants to write an anonymous letter even when he says ""I wont mention you""?  How would they trace an anonymous letter?  Sorry, the moment she turned into a murderer didn't feel believable to me.  It just seemed to me like she panicked for no reason.  

3.  What the fuck happened in that scuffle?  Im sorry, this tiny woman is just hugging this man, who wasn't drinking, SHE WAS DRINKING, and somehow causes him hit the wall and fall with enough force to cause his brain to hemorrhage or something???  Then chokes him out with her forearm while on top?  Total bullshit.  When the guy died and it was over I just laughed because it was so absurd.

4.  Her character is supposed to be intelligent and successful, yet she makes the absolute dumbest decisions every time she decides to commit ANOTHER murder and turns the situation into a worst case scenario every time where she needs to dump another body.  Each time the character decided to kill somebody else, it just felt like the show trying too hard to be disturbing to the viewer no matter if nothing about the plot justified the character to act in such a way.

4440,1519398767,7zopnv,False,4,66,"Charlie Brooker has undeniably found a way to look at the potential chaos wrought on human consciousness, with regards to/with new (and future) technology, and the path that we walk in the age of so-called Newtonian ""scientific truth"", specially in the lacking of there being any mention of ""God"". It's a look into the actual unknown, in darkly prophetic terms. It feels so harrowing because a lot of the topics resonate within us in a way. Only, we'd rather not a) think about doing them, and/or b) acknowledge we would do them.

Brooker has gone on record to state that the term 'Black Mirror' is a poke at our reflection in objects such as tablets, phones, etc. when the screen is powered down. That's quite ominous, but it's not the first time ""black mirrors"" have been used in societies, yet the cool fact (and my point of view) is their purpose has actually always been the same, even to the degree that Charlie Brooker portrays the message(s) through the show.

In terms of history, black mirrors were made of polished obsidian glass (volcanic rock), and were first brought back by Hernando Cortés in 1530 after his conquest of Mexico. The Aztec priests used them to conjure visions and make prophesies of the future. Obsidian mirrors were used ritually to spiritually access the Aztec underworld and communicate with the realm of the dead. They were said to be used for a ruler to see the future, and for others to see themselves look back at them.

Later, John Dee, with the help of a psychic-medium (and convicted criminal) Edward Kelley, had conversations and visions of angels in the mirror’s reflective surface, creating what is known as the ""Ennochian"" language, said to be the precursor to ancient Hebrew, and the language that God used to speak to Adam. These angels (or perhaps demons) requested certain real-world things happen, in payment for the information they imparted. These acts and requests became more and more deprived towards the end of Dee's experimentation.

This is very occult, with little known about what, if anything, was found to be true. Dee believed that this practice would result in the the beings/angels contacted through the mirror, having knowledge that would aid the English in the domination of the known (and at that time, unknown world). Essentially, he sought information that he could use to guide the future. Interestingly, Dee has since been suggested to be a spy for Queen Elizabeth I, and part of the original MI5, and signed his letters with the signature '007'.

Dee would eventually force Kelley to stare into the mirror for long 'scrying' sessions, pushing him to the edge of madness, if not deep into the territory of it.

In summary, black mirrors are said to be a tool of prophesy, but if one looks too hard into them, for too long, madness awaits, and the looker may be consumed by their visions of the possible. In this respect, it may be argued that a black mirror is nothing but the reflection of one's soul in that, it is what the soul wants without heeding any danger (or listening too closely without caution) towards something fundamentally uncertain, and will likely result in a terrible state of reality for them. They spring forth warnings of what may be, possibly even will be.

It seems this is one of the main problems in the Black Mirror universe. For example, in White Christmas, we see a cookie of someone’s consciousness is used to force out a confession. Yes, he confessed- and that is valid proof of a crime, but is it morally right? Should humans have a right to lie without investigators forcing themselves into their thoughts?

Against-will confessions. Not many people are for this, even religion. As we see in Christianity, people are still supposed to ‘confess’ their sins to God. They’re taught that even if God is God, the almighty, they still must confess our sins to him to receive forgiveness. 
-
But are we really that far from this? We already have lie detectors and polygraphs, which are now only voluntary (at least for Americans), which instead of trusting a persons word, use blood pressure to determine if they are telling the truth. 

There are already multiple universities studying [‘recording’ dreams](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.psychologytoday.com/blog/dream-factory/201709/animating-dreams-and-the-future-dream-recording%3famp), essentially being able to access a persons subconscious thoughts. 
As well as a Utah-based startup developing an extremely accurate [lie detector](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2017/10/10/converus-lie-detector-uses-eye-tracking.html) that tracks eye movement using AI, eliminating the need for attaching polygraphs to the body, allowing someone to undergo a lie detector without ever knowing. 

So, what does Reddit think? Do humans have a right to lie about their own actions and thoughts if they can’t be proven? Or should we be able to step into people’s minds to convict a murderer? There’s a lot of situations to think about. Then put yourself in their shoes.

The biggest one for me was the fact that the whole sequence of irl Cole breaking into his house and stealing the DNA items didnt matter because Daly didnt wake up anyways.
       Also, Daly didnt know that the DNA items were taken and it was stated earlier that they had tried the wormhole method but Daly just scanned them back in. With that logic why the fuck did he care about catching them so bad? He wasnt aware that his ability to rescan them was gone. If anything he shouldve been like “Go in that wormhole and Ill rescan you all with no mouth!!” or a threat. That would be more in line with his character and knowledge of the situation. 
         Another thing is why when he came back to the game at the lake didnt he just beam himself back to the Callister? He chose to go to that shitty ship.. which is fine if hes trying to immerse himself BUT he is acting like the situation is game-threatening so wouldnt he use his “God”-like powers to put a stop to it? 

        There were a couple more small ones here and there, and I loved the opposites of Daly in the real world and how he was able to “get revenge” on his coworkers through his ability to code and mod. And I caught many of the Star Trek/70s space cliches (im sure you caught more).

4513,1519191954,7z39qf,False,39,38,"If you recall, at the end of the episode ‘White Christmas’, the character, after his confession is left alone in the cabin, as a man outside sets his time for 1000 years per minute. To scale, this would be more than 1,400,000 years if he did eventually erase him. While outside, only a day would have passed.

Focusing on this, it is possibly the worst thing that can ever happen to a person. Just imagine the same thing forever, trapped in a small cabin, except it’s not forever, and there is an end. One day, in 1.4 million years, which is incomprehensible and basically an eternity, it will end. Knowing that one day his torment will end, because he’s in a machine and it cannot run forever, he is forced to wait and wonder when it will end, for 1.4 MILLION YEARS. For over 1 million years, this man is forced to wonder to himself, when will this end, if ever? 

This brings us to my largest fear, an eternity like this. Sure, I’d love to live forever in a world like heaven. But would you really want to live forever in a world like this man did, with absolutely nothing to do?

Especially as it would have been incredibly easy to fix.

It’s probably safe to assume that everyone at Callister Inc has been inside Infinity. Even Walton, who obviously cares little about the product beyond it making him rich and successful, must have logged in at least once before.

Wouldn’t it have been easier to have Daly extract replicas of their memories and personalities from Infinity, instead of magicing it out of saliva and such?

This also fits much better with Daly’s character as a master coder who built Infinity from scratch. The DNA thing means he’s also a master geneticist, which is possible but odd.

He could even keep his copies in an external HD for safekeeping, allowing all of the Nanette break in stuff to go ahead as usual.

4561,1519074395,7yq5uh,False,6,10,"I recently watched *Fargo* for the first time and I was extremely impressed with it. For the record, I'll be checking out the show soon (""three cheers for Captain Daly"" and all that!).

However, I couldn't help forging connections in my mind between that movie and 'Crocodile'.

First up, it's **the setting**.

*Fargo* is famously set in North Dakota and Minnesota, the snowy landscapes often a focus of the visuals. 

Not only does this imagery play a role in both works I am examining, but the Coen brothers' movie carries a distinct Norwegian flavour throughout its North American setting. *Black Mirror*, however, takes a British cast of characters and transplants them into an Icelandic setting. Whether or not it is Iceland or a future Britain remains unconfirmed, but architectural and infrastructural styles seen in 'Crocodile' suggest it is indeed the former. 

Landscape shots featuring vehicles are also typical and memorable of each work.

And now for **the plot and characters**.

On the surface, the storylines are very different between *Fargo* and 'Crocodile'. However, they repeatedly hit beats with a lot in common, both structurally and contextually.

In *Fargo*, Lundegaard hires two criminals to kidnap his wife as part of an extortion plot. The inept criminals' plan soon leads to multiple brutal murders despite its original intention to end in a feigned resolution. Fans of *Black Mirror* will no doubt recall a similar spiral into serial killing demonstrated by Mia, though it should be noted that her arc started off pretty grim in the first place. 

An unusually fair way into each story we are introduced to our female protagonist, who serves as an investigator to previously established crimes. I believe this story element is of considerable interest because of how relatively unusual this mechanic is and, combined with other noted similarities, I have a strong suspicion that Charlie Brooker may be a Coen brothers admirer!

Neither character is fully aware of the extent to which their investigations will lead, and they are fleshed-out by scenes introducing us to their relationships with their husbands.

Another important similarity on this note would be that of children. *Fargo*'s Marge is pregnant and Shazia from 'Crocodile' has a very young son. A key difference, however, would be that this ends much worse for Shazia and her family (and, hell, that's an understatement). 

On the subject of family, both Mia and Jerry are keeping major secrets from theirs, and we are given intentionally awkward domestic scenes in which the viewer is fully aware of the situation but the secondary characters are not. The scenes in Mia's home remind me of those in which Jerry attempts to keep up the facade of his wife's disappearance for his distraught son.

More coincidentally, but also of note, both crimes at the focus of these stories primarily involve a vehicle as a clue (the car from Lundegaard's salesroom and the pizza van respectively). 

**Conclusion**

The unusual settings and slightly odd structure lead me to believe that the similarities are, in fact, deliberate. I liked 'Crocodile' to begin with (I know it's not the most popular episode ever, heh) but now I can appreciate it even more after watching its excellent, potential inspiration. 

If this is true, 'Crocodile' is a great example of a good homage without in any way being a rip-off. Confirmation from Charlie on this matter would be great someday.

&gt;Yah.

EDIT: on a slightly unrelated note, the setting being Britain really does not add up in terms of geography and architecture, particularly the older stuff.

Judge Hope is clearly a character which is good at manipulation. Doing the same thing for years now, he knows how to fool and influence people, and arrange with the other judges to ""choose their fate"", while doing something more sinister behind the scenes.

When Judge Hope says his line ""Authenticity is woefully in short supply"", is he ACTUALLY expressing his emotions, or putting on a show, trying to calm down the situation, and make everything end good for the rest of the cast as well as the system itself?

Keep in mind, he would not have been appointed as a live audience jury member if he did not know how to react to these situations. They would just be edited and cut out like with the rest of the entertainment provided to the humans in the 15 Million Merits society.

When Michael is invited to the school, they show him an entire dance routine dedicated to how generous he is and give speeches about Michael being their role model. Michael does the only thing he can do: tell the kids that he can’t pay their tuition.

The episode was (The After hours).

How to modernize? A guy is very active on social media with thousands of followers. One day he's phone goes bonkers so following an ad he heads to the apple (or whatever they call it) store to get it fixed. The Employees act strange and send him to a pod to (link) the phone to his brain implant but get interrupted. When he talks to the manager the guy says he's never even heard of his phone model let alone sell it in the store.

It takes some time but he keeps getting headaches and the implant is affecting his vision in sync with the phone's static. Finally the employee tells him to come after hours and he finds a handful of them waiting with a smile leading him to the pod for the sync. 

And to shut him down for maintenance. The guy is an an android same as the employees. they're all unwanted cookies living in an old computer. They made these bodies to attempt to assimilate back into society, the one in this one was in for over a year and he forgot he wasn't really human anymore. 

All of of his communication outside of social media videos was to the other cookies not real people which is why the RL ones he called friend kept a distance when he asked for help like you would a stranger or an acquaintance.

I'd like to hear your pitch for an episode. Has to be a modern day issue (or eternal one) with tech related in some way to the storyline!

Also, if it was kids, why didn't he just get off on his sick fetish by watching YouTube videos or something? Or like type in on google or some shit?

4622,1518927155,7ybzu5,False,5,0,"What made the Twilight Zone so moving was that it had to deal with the intimate emotions humans felt when placed in scenarios brought about by scientific advancements. In fact, the sci-fi elements sometimes hindered the story, as the more realistic the science was the more moving the episode was. For example, in ""The Shelter,"" a group of friends is torn apart because a fallout shelter isn't big enough for everyone. Even though it was a product of it's time, it's still so grounded in humanity that I was even moved as a child. 

This is why ""San Junipero"" upsets me: the characters don't seem to realize that their lives in the simulation are for eternity (a concept that terrifies me to my core). I mean, I can understand Yorkie's excitement, as she has been confined to an immobile body for decades, but Kelly's change of heart honestly shocks me. She was so steadfast in her beliefs, and the idea that young love could change that is honestly laughable. 

Compare this to ""Be Right Back."" At least initially, the technology used seems like something that could be out right now. And if you've ever even thought that someone you love is dead, you'll understand Martha's motivations. She needs someone to talk to about her earth-shattering news, and goes to the closest version of her husband that she can. She realizes that the robot is just a cheap copy of the man she loves, but she can't just get rid of him because *it's still him.*

At this point all I knew about it was that it had a similar mysterious vibe to it, so I decided to give it a go *(didn't even know that it was an anthology series)*.

*Minor spoilers for S04E01 ahead, so tread carefully.*

The episode starts:  [Spoiler Alert](/s ""4:3 ratio and it looks weird, like some old Star Trek series""), which got me thinking that it's some kind of show inside a show. As the story unravels it hooks me more and more with it's twists and intrigues and I find myself enjoying it very much. At some point, I realize my beer is empty, which causes me to pause the video and stand up to get another one. When coming back to the room the overlay has turned on and says in bold: ""Season 4, Episode 1"" and my heart sank. Somehow Netflix started the show with this episode and not the actual first one. I was really worried that I ruined the experience and it actually made me consider just dropping the show for good (I've had a similar experience with a show before). So I decide to ask reddit for advice. After a few minutes, I was told the show is actually just a collection of short stories I was relieved and decided to continue on and afterwards watched S01E01.

And my god, what was that?! I've probably never had a more uncomfortable experience with a TV show. It was not bad at all, I actually enjoyed it somehow, but it definitely made me feel eerie. I was thinking of quitting halfway through, but my overwhelmingly good experience with the first one I watched made me sit through it. So thanks Netflix for the small technical problem, which probably made me actually keep on watching. After 3 more episodes, I can say: I'm hooked.

What if the crew had recruited Real Life Nanette to make a cookie of Daly and insert him into the game?

So Cookie Daly would team up with the crew and provide them with additional information to allow them to dismantle the program from the inside.

Yes, it's the Olympics and it needs to be recorded, but it's also a global event watched by millions. I feel that an episode could be similar to a White Bear concept, where everyone is being watched.

* **Competition** - In general, the Olympics is the best of the best. There is no higher achievement for an athlete than winning the Olympics.

Wow. All the episodes I've seen so far have been kind of morally ambiguous or definitely wrong/right, this is the first episode I personally found myself genuinely unsure of what the moral ""high ground"" was. This was also the first episode that I genuinely did not predict something until the moment it was about to happen. First it leads off with total government surveillance, and in a few seconds it presents the pros and cons to it. That they're spying on the public, but have ""prevented mass shootings and bombings"". With information like that how can a solid train of logic still say whether one side or the other is correct? And the game of who to kill. I found that probably was a commentary on how people basically already do that today, where oftentimes one single person who has not really done something wrong, or just something stupid, finds themselves being bombarded by thousands, or even millions, of unknown people. That there are no consequences. I feel like I agree that there should be consequences, but death? Even still I understand that from a purely logical point of view as study after study has shown that behaviors are both nature and nurture. So effectively committing Genocide of cruel people would significantly reduce cruelty. But the fact they even put a number to the amount reenforces how ingrained it is into society to be cruel, 387,000 people in just 3 days had used that hash tag. That episode just really struck a chord with me personally and I feel presented enough logic to make it difficult for someone to say which of the extremes is better in the situation provided.

The show hit her hard. Much harder than I anticipated. She's called it quits on the series after San Junipero. I should have foreseen this with how she took The Entire History of You and especially Be Right Back. My family lost my father quite quickly to death over 20 years ago. She's said someday she'll tell me about her experiences with the 80s but for now it's no more Black Mirror, or at least no more episodes that deal with topics of love and relationships or set in the 80s. I haven't seen season 4 yet so I was eager to watch it with someone.

Season 4 was really bad compared to the already pretty shameful season 3 imo.
How did we go from to the complex universe building of ""15 million Merits"" to ""BOI TECH BE SPOOKY"". Seriously every episode before season 3 wasn't about how tech is bad or tried to shock you with cheap stuff. 
The first 7 episode were a excellent psycho drama about humanity in the age of technology, they never lacked subtlety, they were in good tase, never derivative. The drama, the shock and the scare never came from technology itself but from the human element or even human interaction and how these were corrupted it by Spectacle (15 million merits), Media (The National Anthem or The Waldo Moment), Loss (I'll Be Back), Isolation (White Christmas) ecc. This corruption was delivered THROUGH technology not BY technology. What made me feel sick during ""I'll Be Back"" wasn't the thought of the bot becoming indipendent and killing her, it was the thought of him doing everything she wanted,  the thought of her replacing the reality of the loss with the fakeness of a bot. After that? Fucking psycho bees? Upvoting people? My mom seing what I see? Playing a videogame that was too realistic? 
This show literally made me so sick (in a good way) that after ""The Entire History of You"" that I didn't sleep, it wasn't the gimmick of the week, it was the crescendo of him going crazy over his obsession to the point of forcing himself to watch his wife having sex with another man.  Even if both he and she were at wrong, I empathized with both so it wasn't forced, it was ambigously realisitic. 
The details plus were great but still subtle in every episode, thanks to them you could still theorize and at the same time they served the purpose to build the universe, always from the ""entire history of you"": think on how much they drank in that episode, how liam was greeted into the house, the discussion in front of the babysitter and how he involuntarily revealed a joke about her... All this stuff made a black mirror episode, all this stuff made it realistic and ACTUAL and thus scary. What's scary about fucking killer bees? How is that technology even practical? It's an episode about online vigilantes? I don't have twitter, I'm safe. I never felt safe during the first 7 episodes, never. Even when the show tried to get political in ""the waldo moment"" it gave me goosebumps and was able at the same time to make a deep sociopolitical commentary. 
Let me talk a bit about this episode now because I feel it's been misunderstood even but it's own creators. This episode did not predicted trump or at least not in the way you think. If you think that the political discourse in america and in the rest of the world was single handedly destroyed by trump you are an idiot. Trump like waldo was a consequence of perceived dishonesty and sense of malaise from the population. Like trump waldo was a pop culture ""icon"" in its country. Like trump waldo was a show""man"". The analogies do end here tho, if you remember the episode ending, before the epilogue, waldo didn't win the election but he had control over the masses. The climax was when the protagonist left the waldo van and showed himself infront of the public who didn't belived him. It wasn't an episode about how ""one day an asshole will become the most powerful guy/thing in the world"" because it was really actual. Big corporations/governments already do put in frontline likable ""outsiders"" (Woman, actors, blacks ecc.)  who speak like the people with language of the people. It's no different from Reagan, will be no different if Oprah if she runs, will/was no different from one of the hundred jokes candidates around the world or talk show hosts with ""pointy"" thongs. The point of this episode was that the other two candidates were losing because they were not percived as incorrect or comedic enough from the people. The girl is the only one who really wanted to do good,  through wrong means tho (again ambiguity), is percived as too posh and dishonest (which she is) and can't really do anything because she's new and not in a position of power doesn't even get to speak during the debate scene. There is no chance of steering from the masses though, there is only chance to speak in an incorrect way through anonymity like waldo does. Again he's outing an exposing of her during the debate wasn't about him not agreeing politically with her but rage about the fact that she didn't pick up the phone. The anxiety of the protagonist causes all the events but you still feel bad for him, he's a tragic and a little patetic figure. He's a low tier, unfunny comedian who's gimmick gets used to first get more ratings and then enslave the population. His anxieties, insecurities and social fobias became real in the climax scene, that's what makes that scene so good: this is black mirror. Socio politcal commentary makes the dystopia  dystopia  + psycho drama about the consequences on human interaction makes the horror.
I just want to add another thing: the epilogue where we se Waldo everywhere was a bit too on the nose but useful, the scariest part was before that in the hospital where he watches the result of on tv. Waldo DOES not win, but though how easily a guy acts as soon as waldo orders to throw a shoes we understand that he has control over the masses, then it fades to black. The worst is yet to come. Now this is fucking scary  (btw I think you should read manufacturing consense to get the episode a lot better)
I talked about this episode because I feel like Charlie Broker thought that his job after  the special was to ""predict what's gonna happen"" and I think this is in part to the fact that people say that black mirror predicted trump. That ""predict what's gonna happen"" totally killed it for me. Charlie, don't predict shit. Talk about the present through dystopic lens that's what this show was about. 
The other thing that really bothers me is how the american press that ignored the show when was on channel 4 now acts all excited for the dumbed down version of it, people will watch probably some episodes from the 3rd or 4th season an give the same amount of attention to the first two who deseve better. Plus the format of netflix doesn't help neither, If i watch more than one episode a day imho you lose all the impact. Infact this was the only show I followed weekly and feel good about it. I had time to think about it. To feel it. To try to digest the trauma, but the putting the details in the head togheter didn't let it go down. It was haunting in every sense. 

Is everything in the new seasons bad? Nono. I like how they are trying new genres and there are a few good episodes here and there (all through nothing like the first 7). I just think what nosedive or san junipero would be like with the quality writing and care for the details of the orginal. 
Yeah Black Mirror is the new Twilight Zone, no doubt about that... But if the show continued the direction of those 7 first and improved them slightly with new genres and more budget, Black Mirror would have easily been one of the all time greats on tv and surely the most terrifying show in history

4764,1518576437,7xexc4,False,5,5,"So let’s start with a little background 

Today I was at track jumping 300m hurdles when I took a nasty fall and lacerated my knee. It wasn’t just a normal skinned knee. It was seriously bad, with multiple major cuts, and the upper layer of skin was gone leaving me with the tender juicy skin below. 
        Earlier that week I had made myself a deal, that if I didn’t get an A on my biology test, I wouldn’t jerk off. Because of this it had been 8 days since the last time I had done it. The hormones were really flowing so when I got my test back today (I got a 91) all I could think about was going home and beating my meat out of the park. All day at school I was fantasizing about finally when I would get the sweet release of when I got some privacy at home. 
            Remembering the part of BM when the doctor started combining pain and orgasms for the ultimate pleasure, I started formulating a plan. I told my friends the plan I had of right when I was about to nut, I would pour rubbing alcohol on my knee for extra stimulation. The said it was a good plan, after all, “no pleasure without pain”. Finally I got home from track with a knee still oozing blood and pus and went to the bathroom with a bottle of rubbing alcohol and a bottle of lotion. After spending approximately 57 minutes finding the perfect video after my jerk deprived week, I plopped a supple squeeze of lotion into my right hand and began stroking. I started slowly, with a twisting motion. I didn’t want to let it go too quickly because after over a week without ejaculation I was extremely sensitive. After about 20 minutes of on off stroking, I was ready for the final 100m dash. I opened the bottle of rubbing alcohol in preparation and began beating a pitch faster than varsity marching band could match. Right as the semen spewed out of my pecker like a busted water main, I poured the entire quart bottle of rubbing alcohol on my wide open knee. For the first second or two I just felt the moisture run down my knee. Then all of a sudden, I felt the worst pain I had ever felt in my life. It felt like all the demons of hell were trapped in my knee and tearing their  way out right through my tender epidermis. However, the blinding pain of my knee paired perfectly with the weeks worth of meat beating that was just unleashed. My eyes started to black out and rolled back in their sockets slightly. My entire body started to vibrate and my heart felt like it was beating out of my chest. I didn’t even have time to clear my search history, which was dirtier than a hoarders dead pet cat. I jumped up and thrust my knee under the cool water of the shower, already turned on to mask the sound of my “sinning” going on in that bathroom. Suddenly I reached nirvana. The sensory overload from orgasming, the burning pain from my knee, my sore joints, the black spots on my vision, and the cool water of the shower hit me in just the right way. The feeling is indescribable. I felt like my head turned into a balloon and lifted my body away from the earth. It was the best thing I’ve ever felt in my life and I will probably ever feel again. 
      
I know I won’t reach this again. It was the peak of my life and it’s probably going to be downhill from here. 
9/10 would try again 

TL:DR I masturbated and poured rubbing alcohol in an open wound at the same time.

4881,1518355858,7wssay,False,26,60,"When I watched the episode the first time, I was expecting an ending that would explain what happened to that world.

I was disappointed when the episode ended. I googled other people's analysis and views on this episode (that was around a month ago) and there was no satisfying answer. Some came with wild theories.

So I came to this conclusion, which still seems unpopular but for me, it makes a lot of sense. Perhaps someone else came up with the same analysis but I didn't find anyone so far who shares the same opinion.


I think this episode is about humans creating weapons without really thinking of the consequences. I think this is the darkest BM episodes. It's really possible to create a killer robot dog that would ruin life as we know it. Other episodes are more about controlling the consciousness but technology is not that advanced so far.

This issue is not futuristic, it happened in the past (Guns, Nuclear Bombs). Weapons that make the killing is easier and faster, the ones who invented them was probably thinking about money, political win. Not keeping in mind if others owned powerful weapons they would use it against the ones who created them in the first place. = Making us weaker and under their mercy.

So in that world, someone created a powerful smart robot dog. Humans were unable to stop them. 

The dolls at the end, It shows that people would risk their lives for sentimental things, like making your nephew happy, or get rich (by selling weapons) in order to pay bills and buy a lot of stuff. Creating weapons in order to gain money is as absurd as risk your life for a doll to make a kid happy (getting shiny things for you only to enjoy).

4926,1518187552,7wdvh0,False,4,3,"I've seen a few posts which has brought this question to my mind. I am not agreeing with Garrett Sholes actions though Im pretty sure I understand his motives. The part that scares me is how much I agree with his argument about how hateful words shouldn't be thoughtlessly thrown around online. On top of that, the #Deathto movement was an aweful trend. It takes a special sort of evil to wish death to someone based off a mistake made in the spotlight of social media. 

They show Jo Powers who wrote a particularly nasty post, and Tusk who made some douchebag comments to a 9 year old, in ear shot of the kid. So yeah, one could argue that the hate was justified with those two. But then we get a young lady who drunkenly made the mistake of being obnoxious. Not really deserving of a death sentence at all. THEN we are introduced to the poor woman who attempted suicide due to the overwhelming hate directed at her because of an innocent mistake.

Unfortunately for the 379k people who were using the hashtag, Garrett Sholes cared about this woman. It was the catalyst to the entire tragedy.   People need to understand how much impact their own words can potentially have on someone. What is the best way to do this? Make them accountable for their blind, unsympathetic hate.

I understand his logic. The question I've been asking myself is this, Who is most to blame for the events? Garett set up the system which lead to the horrible deaths of all those online assholes, but the NSA agent pushed the button. Even though it was brought to light that a man this meticulous wouldnt leave crumbs to follow. They stopped to think about it but the NSA guy insists on pushing button. Jack Kevorkian helped terminally ill patients, who could not endure the suffering any longer, to commit suicide. He just built the machine to help end their lives, the patients pushed the button and they tried pinning him with the deaths. Im aware of how different the two situations are but I still havnt found a concrete, acceptable answer to the question i ask you now,  Who is to blame, the asshole  people/Garett Sholes/NSA agent?

4937,1518162532,7wbyfu,False,3,4,"So the thing that really didn't want to leave my mind were the cookies and their conscience. I personally think that a bunch of code that just copies a person's brain isn't necessarily exactly the same as the person it copied. It might behave like the person and seem to have all the same emotions but how do we know they're self aware like us? The computer makes it behave so but that doesn't have to mean it is.

But anyway, if the cookie version of a person is actually self aware, this came to mind. The cookie remembers the original's entire life and believes they're the real them. But they do not remember the decision and process it took for it to start existing. I think it should remember that. If they're able to erase those memories, they should be able to program them to be more obedient too. And what's the point of making them forget it if they're told later anyway? (except the interrogation maybe) 

So, let's pretend they do remember.

If this service really existed, the people who choose to use it can't be sure if their conscience ends up as the real person or as the cookie. It just gets split into two copies and you could actually be the copy that ends up in the eggy thing. How would we know this life we're living now isn't just a cookie's memory? Imagine that, deciding to make a little helper for your house only to end up as them. And this would happen every time. If it wasn't you, it would be the other you that only gets made afterwards but is already in the process of making for your entire life. It's scary. I really don't think people would use it that often if it meant the risk of becoming the cookie themselves. Which would inherently have to happen if they're actually conscious like many of you believe.

_(Inspired by a true story)_

A wealthy man, Marcus, is the first subject in a new cloning project where people can transfer their consciousnesses into designer bodies that are created in a lab. Marcus hates his born body with a passion, hating his mediocre height, looks, and even skin tone. He spent much of his own money funding the research for this project. The day finally arrives and Marcus is going to be able to transfer out of his old body, which he deems completely genetically worthless, and into the tall, handsome, fit body he deems best reflects his personality. One of the nurses, Josie, doesn't see his body the way Marcus sees it, but Marcus insists his body is trash and wants it disposed once the transfer is complete. The day comes and Marcus is able to move into his new tall, handsome, fit body. The process is a success. Once in his new body, he orders his old body to be disposed, arguing it's so worthless, it's not even fit for organ donation. 

Josie the nurse is tasked to get rid of the body, but she waits until after hours and manages to smuggle the body into her car and drive home with it. At home, she is greeted by her brother, who is severely crippled and in a wheelchair. Josie tells her brother Billy she has a donor body for him. Using the equipment and machinery at home, Josie is able to transfer her crippled brother into Marcus' old body, and the process is a success. Billy awakens in Marcus' old body, overjoyed at his ability to walk and be relatively healthy.

As the new and improved Marcus enjoys his new body, he starts to become a bit arrogant and is surprised when his new ""perfect"" body doesn't guarantee him success with women and instant respect from others like he thought it would. In the meanwhile, Billy enjoys all the things he can now do in life, like running and playing at a playground. As Marcus becomes frustrated that his new body isn't giving him the perfect life he expected it to, Billy decides to volunteer his time at a homeless shelter and meets a young Arab girl there, Shari, who is also a volunteer. She's not a looker, but Billy quickly becomes her friend. Soon, Shari falls in love with Bill due to his kindness and humility. Billy is living a happy life, while Marcus continues to be unhappy even in his perfect body.

One day, the news media captures coverage of Billy at the homeless shelter, where he's become known as a local community hero. Marcus sees him in the news however and is furious. Marcus sues the cloning facility for not disposing of his old body like he asked and the story makes headlines. To save face, Josie admits she was the one who spared the body, and that it wasn't her employers fault. Marcus doesn't care and wants his old body destroyed. Josie and Billy try to plead with him and ask him why. Marcus tells them why: his old body is a sign of everything that ruined his life. Women found him to be too short and unattractive in it and it made him depressed and suicidal. He loathes everything about his old body and its the reason he funded the cloning project to begin with. Josie manages to show Marcus everything that Billy, her formerly paralyzed brother, was able to do in his body, however. He managed to garner popularity and even a girlfriend, all the things Marcus could never do in his old body. Josie tells him that his self-hatred comes from within, not just from the external appearance. After holding back tears, Marcus decides to drop the lawsuit and let Billy stay in his old body after all. He admits being in the perfect body didn't fix his problems findng love and self-acceptance, so Billy is able to use his old body as he wishes.

Marcus decides to see a therapist and Billy proposes to Shari. The story ends with Billy giving a speech to a group of would-be participants of the cloning procedure to learn to accept the body you've been given, as there will always be someone out there who likes you as you are, and things could always be worse.",False,blackmirror,Black Mirror Fan Episode pitch

This is an extremely morally problematic view of things.  First, a DNA replication/RNA transcription chapter in Biology class will make it clear that any of us human beings are ""just code.""  But more importantly, treatment of any being cannot be based simply on our perception of what ""kind"" of thing it is.  Empathy is an instinctive response to the perception of an emotional experience in another being.  People have empathy toward animals because we can perceive and actually relate to what we see to be their fear, physical pain, hunger, etc. It doesn't matter that they are different kinds of beings from us.


The moment we begin defending a lack of empathy based on the kind of thing we think someone or something is, then we're basically in the world of Men Against Fire, insisting that it doesn't matter if we dehumanize (or de-personalize) certain people because they aren't the ""right kind"" of humans to deserve an empathetic response.  


Daly was evil because he actually enjoyed causing the digital clones to suffer, knowing that that suffering was wholly felt by them.  He couldn't gain the respect of individuals with independent will and emotion in his normal life, so he created another universe in which he could control externals but still had no control over the will and emotion of the digital clones.  He had no more ability to gain their respect in the Infinity universe than in his normal life, so he used various physical punishments, humiliations, and emotional blackmail to coerce them into submission, which was based purely on fear.  But they always retained their own will and independent emotional response.  Daly just created a universe in which he wouldn't experience the negative consequences of his actions, as he would in his normal life.  


By contrast pop Mario Bros. into your classic Nintendo, and the Mario and Luigi avatars are mere representations of the choices you, the player makes.  They only move when you indicate to move.  Even with advanced games, the same is true, just on a more sophisticated level.  Characters/events not initiated by players are nevertheless dictated by the game developer.  This is *not* the case with digital clones/cookies.  Their will and emotional response is always independent and based on their own personality, life experiences, and values, just like with human persons.  

The fact of the matter is that cookies/digital clones have, one, independent will, and two, the full range of human psychological and emotional responses that are triggered by outside forces, but *not* determined by them.  This means that cookies/digital clones are not simply representations of a techie's thought process.  The assertion of their will and emotional response is just as valid as that of a natural human being.  

I think one very interesting theme throughout Black Mirror is exactly this--how easily we decide that certain people aren't sufficiently like us to deserve our empathy, despite clearly being able to think, feel, act, hope, etc. as we do.

The only non-human-but humanish character in Black Mirror thus far that I believe was not really a person was posthumous Ash, whose digital footprint was downloaded into some type of highly-realistic android.  Like a video game avatar, the Ash-droid, was only simulating what had been downloaded from past conversations.  He had no independent will nor emotion, but simply displayed what he was ""supposed to.""  He didn't really care about being made to stand outside all night, confronting death, or being stuffed in an attic for years on end.  He had no sexual response because that data hadn't been provided to him.  He just displayed the patterns of behavior that he had been provided.

See, I'm not a fan of happy endings in my Black Mirror. I love the feeling of a pain in my stomach, an inability to breathe and ten minutes of internal reflection following my episode. This is why Shut Up and Dance is my absolute favourite episode and San Junipero is my least (Yeah, I said it. I think San Junipero is the worst episode. C'mon, then, hit me.).

But I realised something - those three episodes I mentioned earlier had a sort of Nosedive-esque ending (where things initially seem like a good ending but, upon further reflection, are actually darker and sadder than presented).

USS Callister ends with a man literally being killed for torturing code that cannot truly feel anything. A genius, a prodigy and a social outcast murdered by a bunch of ones and zeros. 

Black Museum ends with a man literally being killed for torturing code that cannot truly feel anyth-... wait... hang on...? Also, given the nature of the replicas of the screaming criminal, the death of the original hologram of the criminal doesn't do much when there are literally tens of thousands of copies of him, all in eternal pain forever.

Hang the DJ ends with... uh... okay... *that* is a truly happy ending, sure. Does that make it a bad episode? Not necessarily. Many people like San Junipero because they think it's well-written and brilliantly executed, despite its lack of a dark ending. While I personally disagree, I *do* see that in Hang the DJ.

I'll start.

--

**Awkward for the Wrong Reasons**

I will admit that I was uncomfortable from the moment Nish put herself in close quarters with the sleazy museum proprietor, for no other reason than that I felt like I was the one stuck alone with this guy, trying to make small talk while my car charged.  There was something effectively ""tight"" and intimate about the scene that made my introvert-nerves stand on edge.  Of course I want and expect BM to make me uncomfortable, but social discomfort isn't a novel experience for me, so I wasn't loving it.

To be clear, I didn't hold this as a strike against the episode, but I wasn't thrilled when the story proceeded in the same vein, with Rolo narrating rather than the story being experienced exclusively through the characters, first-hand.  Interestingly, this wasn't an issue for me with White Christmas, so it may just be the car-salesmanship of Rolo and the setting that I didn't like, but I think it's more than that.

**Low Immersion**

In White Christmas, you are effectively placed in Potter's position.  You wake up in this cabin, stuck alone with this one other guy, trading stories about your life because there's fuck-all else to do.  Although Matt narrates periodically, much of the action unfolds without interjection.  A similar thing was done with Black Museum, but it felt like we were pulled out of the story with greater frequency, perhaps because the stories were shorter, or perhaps to emphasize the fact that the truth of the stories were reliant on Rolo, the narrator.  I suspect the latter and appreciate the intent, but it did cause me to feel more detached throughout the episode.

**Lazy Punches**

Laying aside the narrative framework, the stories themselves seemed much more satirical than many or most other episodes.  I believe I like the episodes best the more plausible I find them.  Arkangel was a good case in point, as I was struggling to suspend disbelief that such a technology would be used... but I was satisfied by the explanation that it was still in beta.  Black Museum threw out one blatantly terrible idea after another and made no effort to justify the absurdity.  You could blame this on the unreliable narrator or on time constraints of the episode, but it's unsatisfying to me as a viewer.  It was difficult to sympathize with the characters or to imagine being in their position.  It was pointedly absurd, and consequently easier to predict the fallout.  Of course a doctor addicted to pain and death will become the minister of such, and of course sticking a whole other human being in your head - effectively giving yourself schizophrenia - isn't going to be a honeymoon forever.

Even most moments of disturbance were over-the-top sucker-punches rather than understated slow-burning mind-fucks.  My brother and I have never simultaneously averted our eyes but we did from the bathroom scene with the doctor.  It was disgusting, painful, repulsive... but not psychologically thrilling.

**Missing the Mark**

The only element of the episode which bordered on traditional black-mirror-standard disturbing, for me, was the suggestion that each souvenir ""snapshot"" of Nish's dad captured at his moment of agony was actually a little immortal bit of consciousness trapped for all eternity in that second of fathomless pain.  To be honest, the mom-in-the-monkey and dad-in-the-glass-room were just reiterations of themes we've already seen done to better effect in White Christmas, Callister, etc., so there was nothing new to be scandalized by.  The snapshot was the only tid bit to suggest that there may still be untapped alternative hells, worse than we've yet imagined.  

If I were Nish and I thought some authentic part of my dad's conscious existence were being tortured inside that chamber, I wouldn't be able to sleep nights thinking there are hundreds of little copies of him floating around all over the world screaming in eternal agony.  A better episode might have been about the hauntingly insurmountable task of tracking down and recovering every one of those keychains before her dad's soul could really be put to rest.

**Pandering**

Finally, the ending rang a bit hollow, probably because it felt a bit too traditional.  I'm not *displeased*, per se, that dad-in-the-cage was liberated or Rolo got a little taste of his own medicine, but the ""solution"" was superficial - it only applied to an isolated incident - and yet by satisfying the viewer that justice has been served, it stymies intellectual conversation.  Some will still pursue the unsettled threads of the thought experiment down the perennial rabbit hole, but most will be sated by the short-term settlement.  The episode will not haunt them and thus will not achieve the longevity that more strenuously unnerving episodes have achieved in the public consciousness.

**Pointless Plot Twists**

Also, I didn't get anything out of the mom-in-Nish's head, aspect.  It detracted somewhat from Nish's own motivations and strength as a character, and reopened the whole absurd can-of-worms that injecting an immortal digital copy of your SO or parent into your own head represents.  It made her less believable.

Now, if the whole episode had been a close examination of how such a seemingly positive development could go horribly wrong, that might have been a stronger episode.  But that was Arkangel.

**&amp;etc**

A disappointing episode of Black Mirror is still a good episode in the general pantheon of contemporary entertainment, in my book.  But while this episode was conventionally entertaining to me, it wasn't gripping, unpredictable, or take-my-hand-and-lead-me-straight-to-the-darkest-most-prohibitive-and-untresspassed-regions of-my-mind disturbing.

All he knows is wealth and he has never travelled outside the gates at all. His sister and his parents and “his friends” only talk about the new stuff they buy and the main character is miserable because he tries making a crack exposing the world around him for what it is but he constantly gets a negative reaction.

He wakes up one day to see he is in a run down house with a water pipe bursting in the room. A older woman and man rush in to fix the pipe and the main character tries getting their attention but the woman and man ignore his presence.

He walks to school and then he’s ambushed by an older gentlemen in a hoodie and taken behind a bush.

The old man says “We need to go before they transfer you.”

He is confused but they head to a maximum security building.

As they are breaking in the building, the story becomes clear to the main character.

The United States has a fierce abortion debate where a company resolved it by running the neurons of developed fetuses into a computer simulation of the EtherSpace. The main character was one of those fetuses and the building he is in has to facilitate the transfer of the main character from fetus into EtherSpace every day to ensure all parallel universes can obtain the transfer. If the building fails to do it one day, the fetus cannot be aborted by law.

The main character has an existential moment of whether he wants to commit suicide and he comes to terms as he realizes how materialistic the world is.

They come close the stopping the transfer and the main character is so close to pushing the button to stop the transfer but the guards grab him and pull him out as he’s screaming for death.

5236,1517404509,7u9sl8,False,9,22,"Black Museum didn't quite hit home for me because I thought the story would go in a different direction.  When I saw all the references to old episodes, I thought Black Museum would actually work best as a more 'meta' episode which takes stock and comments more explicitly on how Black Mirror itself has changed.

Here's where I thought it would go. Apologies for where this rears into fan fiction but bear with me and see if you think this alternative direction would have been interesting:

* Everything is the same up to two thirds of the way through. First the Pain Addict story, then the Monkey story. 

* After the Monkey story, Nish says that all of Rolo's stories follow the same pattern. Everything is fine until someone enters a deal with a devil which dooms them to a type of technological hell (as Nish says, ""there's always a 'but'""). 

* Nish says she doesn't understand Rolo's fascination with these stories.  She's a technological optimist. She believes that with the right will, technology can do good for the world. Human rights and neuro-ethicists now protect against the dangers these stories warn against.  Wrongs can be righted. Rolo scoffs. It's the potential horrors that interest him most. 

* Rolo leads Nish next door to the final room and the main attraction of the Black Museum: The Black Box. Its an immersive VR device which detects your worst fear and shows how technology can make it a reality (a licenced version of the technology shown in 'Playtest').  Rolo says that this is intended to demonstrate the real message behind the Black Museum: technology can have a terrible human cost. 

* Nish agrees to use the Black Box and we see the start of her story.  When she was a young student she was involved in an accident and couldn't take part in social student activities, so signed up to a videogame service called Friendo. Friendo is a simulated buddy that scans the manner of speech of Facebook friends and Twitter followers and then acts like them when playing as a companion for online video games (similar technology from the company that replicated Ash in 'Be Right Back'). This cures her loneliness for a while, but then her simulated buddy starts asking her questions that are too intimate, displaying knowledge about every single aspect of her life. Creeped out, she quits Friendo. Deciding to get out there now she has recovered from her accident, she hooks up with a student named Alex.  The relationship develops quickly until Alex goes abroad to the US for a semester. Alex and Nish enter a long-distance relationship. One day, during a virtual reality call with Alex, the two decide to have cybersex. Just before she takes her clothes off, the door bell starts to ring insistently. She runs downstairs eventually and Alex is at the door, ""Surprise!"" 

* The story abruptly ends as Nish pulls herself out of the Black Box VR simulation. We see that she is also now wearing the diagnostic hair net, which Rolo has put on her after she started the Black Box simulation.  She takes it off and goes to a back room where she confronts Rolo.   He is paralyzed because she has slipped nerve agent into his water and is clutching an implant at the top of his spine while she has been in the VR simulation.  

* Nish explains that when she was a student she used the Black Box and was so terrified of what it showed her, she had recurring nightmares and had to drop out of university. She would keep coming back to the Black Museum to face her fears.  Nish slowly learned that Rolo was in fact the doctor in the Pain Addict story who is able to feel the sensations of people wearing the hairnet through an implant on his spine.  However, he didn't turn into a serial killer, he got addicted to leaching off the fear of patients.  Rolo had turned that into a money-making enterprise when he invented the Black Museum, using the Black Box as the best way to get people terrified and experience their fear vicariously.  The horrifying effects of the Black Box are now publicly known, and explain why the Museum is now deserted.

* Nish puts the hairnet on the paralyzed Rolo and then also the Black Box VR machine over his eyes.  This is her revenge. The more terrified Rolo gets, the more intensely he will feel afraid because of the hairnet, which will then cue the Black Box to learn the true limits of Rolo's terror etc. etc.  As Rolo enters a recursive, exponential loop of increasing terror, we see a lighting quick montage of horrifying images as he lets out a bloodcurdling scream. 

* Nish grabs the Monkey toy.  It says quietly 'I Need a Hug' as she practically skips out of the Museum with Rolo's screams echoing from the Museum in the middle of the desert. ",True,blackmirror,A different ending for Black Museum that goes even more 'meta' - S04E06 - [Spoilers]

It seems like they should enter each simulation as a blank slate.
2. Everyone else freezes when Amy and Frank decide to rebel. This implies that the simulation is just for Amy and Frank, and all the other people are just set decoration. But what about when, for example, Frank encounters the guy that Amy is dating for 9 months? Is he a simulation, or is he 'real', i.e. is the simulation for him as it is for Amy and Frank? If so, it means some of the people in it are not just set dressing. The fact that the characters go to a gathering where they socialize [as opposed to the restaurant, where they don't really seem to talk to other people] is confusing in that regard.

But you get the impression that 'Coach' knows these two are a match, so it's just trying to get them to rebel for the 998th time and resolve this.
EDIT: 4. This might be the biggest thing that started bothering me once I thought about it. Some people are just more apt to chafe against authority and rebel. Others essentially never rebel. Rebellious people are going to pair up with someone faster and not necessarily with their top match. Others might meet their perfect match, but if they are both extremely compliant with authority, they won't wind up together. Each will wind up with a more rebellious person, because the rebellious person is going to have a hard job getting the compliant person to rebel. If millions and millions of simulations are run, it will eventually happen.

tl;dr - Basically why haven't we come into contact with alien life

One of my favorite hypothesis:

**They tend to isolate themselves**

It has been suggested that some advanced beings may divest themselves of physical form, create massive artificial virtual environments, transfer themselves into these environments through mind uploading, and exist totally within virtual worlds, ignoring the external physical universe.[96]

It may also be that intelligent alien life develops an ""increasing disinterest"" in their outside world.[97] Possibly any sufficiently advanced society will develop highly engaging media and entertainment well before the capacity for advanced space travel, and that the rate of appeal of these social contrivances is destined, because of their inherent reduced complexity, to overtake any desire for complex, expensive endeavors such as space exploration and communication. Once any sufficiently advanced civilization becomes able to master its environment, and most of its physical needs are met through technology, various ""social and entertainment technologies"", including virtual reality, are postulated to become the primary drivers and motivations of that civilization.[98] 

tl;dr Advanced races might find isolation in virtual technology and find no need to explore and leave their world.

5300,1517228129,7trwg8,False,10,3,"Hey guys!

First of all, I'd like to say that I'm a huge fun of Black Mirror. Some episodes are my favorites of all TV series ever seen. It is a great series, and I really like it so much. I also like how it stands as a warning for humanity, as though it is saying ""Watch out! You're moving towards some nasty future, where things are fucked up. Tread lightly"". I like how every episode is a standalone, showing a world where things can be perceived as fucked up, but then, it reminds you that we aren't *that* far from it.

**Background:** Lately, I've started thinking of a new theme and decided to name it ""Money Time"". The emphasis of this so called episode is ""Time is money"". It is in some ways similar to the movie ""In Time"" where currency is time, however, money is still money. Nothing has really changed from what we know, however, some systems are slightly altered, which changes everything.

**The concept:** The world is the same as we know it. However, it has become a trend worldwide to include time when deciding a payment over a product or a salary. Similar to how there are pizza services where, if the pizza delivery took longer than half an hour, it is free. What if, instead, the payment for the pizza was proportional to how long the delivery took? For instance, the base price of pizza is 20$, and every minute that you waited for it, the price goes down by 1$. Another example would be a taxi driver, where instead of counting up, the longer the taxi driver took to get you to your destination, his payment actually goes down. When talking about retail managers, a monetary objective is set, and every day that it takes that manager to reach it, the management above takes a portion of that manager's pay. A client's payment in a restaurant for foods and drinks goes down for every minute he or she had to wait, and so on and so on. 

**The (possible) aftereffects:** As time is calculated into everything, the general profits of most jobs go down. Assuming that it also affects salaries, the base prices can't go up, as the economy is heavily pulled downwards, and people will be unable to pay prices that were possible before. This means that some will have to work on more than one job, shortening the free time and increasing workload. As more people have to work, the more need for small jobs also appear, such as babysitting, fixing, gardening and other household stuff that a person usually does by himself. A single parent won't be able to finance a family cell of a father, mother and a child in this ecosystem, leading to both parents working.

**The Tech:** Because of the need for small jobs, a ""portal"" of sorts has been developed. It is very similar to what we have today for people looking for jobs, but it is very focused, has high levels of details for every person's profile. Basically, this portal offers Limited Time Jobs. Those open up and close at fixed intervals set up by the profile's manager. People who take those jobs are measured in time, from the moment of accepting until finishing the job, for a price based on time taken. As the job completes, the portal immediately transfers the payment from the job creator into the one who made the job.

Now, I would love a few opinions on this:

1. Assuming the trend to measure payments based on time, how do you think the ecosystem would actually be?

2. What about jobs, profits, salaries, availability, skill levels and requirements for said jobs? How would they be affected?

3. What about human behavior? (e.g. taxi drivers would have to drive extremely fast and dangerously in order to reach destinations without losing too much money for the ride). What about their day to day routines? How would they be affected?

4. Any other changes on the ecosystem for people that I haven't thought about?

5. Assuming it becomes a Black Mirror episode, how would it go? Who would be starring (e.g. what occupation, race, standing etc.) What would be the general plot?

5314,1517198873,7tpph8,False,14,54,"I was rewatching White Christmas today and the overarching story about John Hamms character getting blocked by the entire world got me thinking. In the Black Mirror universe, when you are legally blocked by someone, you can’t see them until the person either reverses it or they die (i.e, the third story from White Christmas). I think an interesting future episode of Black Mirror could be about a man put on the registry and is blocked by the entire world, goes insane from the isolation, and becomes a serial killer for the sole purpose of being able to see human faces again.

Edit: I love all the comments under this post speculation is always fun. In response to some of the comments, I don’t think Black Mirror always has to leave us with questions. Think about the episode Men Against Fire. It was a critique on how abusing technology can blur the lines morally for soldiers and the public. The hypothetical  episode’s overarching theme could be about the prison system in America and other first world countries. Not very sure about the exact statistics but a whole lot of inmates who are set free return to a life of crime because they weren’t properly reintroduced into normal society in life (the analogy in the episode being that the prisoner can’t be normal again because he can’t see anyone for who they are). At the end of the day, is being free even worth it if you can’t interact with the world around you? The man in question can’t see or hear anyone, physically or even mentally (the block distorts memories because the zed-eyes record everything) and he couldn’t even have the privilege of masturbating because the actors would be blocked (can’t enjoy hentai either because the voice overs would be blocked too). Its a ripe breeding ground for insanity and it would be a direct result of the block. You could even throw in opposition to the punishment throughout the episode.

Literally just thought of this: you can’t take out the zed-eyes because it will kill you so the end of the episode could be the main character hiding from the international manhunt that inevitably will occur and kill himself trying to take the tech out of his head, similarly to what happened in The Entire History of You.

I've seen people on here try to guess what lead to the world of Metalhead.  My guess is that it's the end game for the White Bear Justice Park.

At that point, the public will grow bored and they will want to move on to the next.  
  
This is where Metalhead comes in.  Metalhead is a military testing site.  In White Bear we've already seen that society at large cares little for the welfare of prisoners.  So, it goes to assume instead of just executing prisoners, they would want to make use of them first.  The three people we see in Metalhead are all on death row.  They're dropped into Metalhead with their memories replaced, and a set of actors (the sister and 'sick' child) work like the actors in White Bear, moving the criminals along.  This way, society gets a little more value from its prisoners, gathering information about the weaknesses of the robots.

So I thought of an episode, that if executed correctly would be nothing short of a masterpiece. It's just a vague idea right now.

Me and my gf talked about VR technology and how it will take over many young peoples minds in the future when it's much more widespread. I imagine people being hours on end in their room playing, but unlike now, with VR it will feel very different and SO much more **real**

So the idea I have is a young guy/girl who is basically choosing VR life over their normal life. I imagine a game where you are basically God. You create the environment from imagination. You can spawn anything and anyone you like. You can travel anywhere and expand your world in there. You can fly. You are God in this game.

I imagine every time the person has to exit the VR world to eat/toilet etc. they become more and more depressed. And ultimately taking their own life, or doing something extreme like killing someone else to actually feel something outside their VR world.

As I said it's just a rough idea, but executed perfectly, and worked on by professionals I feel this could be the best episode of the series.

5466,1516910714,7syw25,False,21,1,"Hey,

so maybe I'm a bit late to the party, but I just had to share my views on the first episode of season 4, also because I couldn't find them anywhere else on this subreddit:

Tbh, I didn't think this episode had a happy ending and I didn't think Daly was too bad of a person.
Let me start with the fact, that all of the characters IN the game are purely an artificial intelligence (AI). They are simply some code on his PC that don't have actual feelings and stuff. Sure, you can program them to act like they have them, to behave like actual humans, but they aren't. They are like realistic Sims. 
Now let's say you can actually copy a whole person + his memories and behavior with the DNA (the second part which I don't think will ever be possible), they would then still be code, and could be manipulated. Why wouldn't Daly just make them obedient? Or at least some of them. And even then, why would anybody care how Daly treats them? Oh poor code, imitating fear etc. I really couldn't care for any of them, since I knew they weren't actual human beings. And the fact that the episode ends with some AI escaping and the real human possibly dying (at least it seems implied), I don't understand how that could be a happy ending...

Don't get me wrong, the fact that he stole everybody's DNA and how he behaved in-game, especially with Walton's kid, is very strange and he definitely has some psychological issues. But if your best friend murdered everybody in Skyrim, would you care? Or judge him? Or would you judge him by the way he behaved in real life? And what bad has Daly done in real life? He should've spoken up to Walton or seen someone and try to fix his problems that way. But letting it all out in some very realistic computer game isn't the worst method either, definitely not for anybody but him.

What I honestly take out of this episode is:

-Have some backbone

-Make sure AI wouldn't endanger an actual human

-Give your AI  genitals

EDIT: As some people have pointed out, my Skyrim comparison isn't quite the same as virtually killing/torturing/oppressing people you know in real life. At least on a psychological level. On the level of actual real life consequences though, it's pretty much the same. One code might be more sophisticated, but it's still Ones and Zeros, not flesh and blood.

Men Against Fire - The twist is kinda predictable. Lets have it turn out Stripe's MASS system malfunctioned and the Roaches really are mutants. I know the show hasn't used straight up monsters before but that's what makes it so unpredictable.

Arkangel - Instead of censoring things, Marie uses Arkangel to make Sara afraid of things Marie thinks might hurt her. This is something a helicopter parent is more likely to do.

Whole premise for the idea wasn't that original (I feel like cookie stuff was very similar) and the episode most of the time (pretty much until the ending) was just boring for me. It didn't feel like black mirror at all. There was this powerful scene where Kelly explains to the other woman why she's not going to stay in SJ, only to be ruined by her change of mind, just like that. I thought maybe Kelly decided to pass over to found out that her wife opted-out, but nothing like this happened and ending just left cheesy taste in my mouth.

So what I think is that the last scenes with the girls were their last day together - as Kelly saying good bye. And insides of SJ company, with moving capsules and stuff was to indicate that Kelly is opting-out from the system.

don't hate me, but I think (some) people loved this episode, because it was about lesbians.

I consider there are plenty of new technologies and problems to explore, which already exist, such as genetic manipulation, workforce automation, global warming, ocean acidification, lack of human connection.

In the early stages of the episode, when Mia's ex-boyfriend shows her the newspaper clipping about the victim's wife still looking for her husband, I had a thought. What if this woman was the wife of a completely different guy other than the one they ran over? I mean the article seemed to include one photo of the guy. Mia and her ex-boyfriend only saw the guy after he'd been hit and killed by their car and put him in the sleeping bag pretty quickly. I find it hard to believe that after 15 years the boyfriend (who hinted at being a recovering alcoholic) recognised this guy as being 100% their victim, based on one or two pictures (especially as they admitted to being over the influence at the time). I'm pretty sure there's a word for when killers misidentify their victims due to guilt, if they see a story with similar circumstances.

5614,1516726811,7sfsz6,False,6,3,"I finished Hated in the Nation last night and absolutely enjoyed it. It wasn't the most creative, or ground breaking episode, but the acting was solid, the protagonists were relatable, and the social media theme was incredibly timely. Further, the feature-length format gave a great amount of time to cover, adequately at least, the technohorror plotlines to fruition. In that regard, it was similar to White Christmas.

However, I agree with most critiques in that the episode probably doesn't belong on the Mount Rushmore of BM episodes. The plot was extremely formulaic with it delving into Law &amp; Order witness interviews and somewhat capitalizing on the Nordic noir wave that came to prominence a few years ago with The Killing and the Millenium Trilogy books and films.

Another big issue I had was its scale of mystery and catastrophe--in that it wasn't LARGE enough. First, let me get into some background on why I think this: I saw Season 3 of BM as its attempt to crack into mainstream of Western entertainment. Season 2's White Christmas was a preview, with TV A-lister Jon Hamm in a prominent role in a well-crafted, enjoyable, and disturbing holiday special. Season 3's opener was similarly mainstream-targeted, with near-A list celebrity Bryce Dallas-Howard in an incredible performance. Nosedive was disturbingly timely and accurate, and a great 'light' episode to draw in a larger audience. Playtest was short and fun. BM delivered arguably its best episode in San Junipero, an even lighter episode that has an almost wholesome message about sexuality, relationships, elder care, and the afterlife. Shut up and Dance was a dark, unpleasant (but solid) delivery for core fans. Men Against Fire was timely, dark, and a much-needed critique on war that could reflect any nation's military. And, then, Hated in the Nation as the finale. 

Until then, BM has progressively opened the door for more American characters and actors, while generally staying in the British Isles, with a few exceptions. Here's where my biggest issue with Hated in the Nation comes in: This feature length episode was ideally suited to become the first global scale BM episode, one that the whole world could have related to geographically. In the episode, we are treated several times to a map of the UK. However, our society has become unmistakably globalized, especially in the social media and Internet contexts. I found it a bit cheap that the events in Hated in the Nation were limited to the UK. 

I would like to have seen this investigation start in the UK, with Karin and Blue investigating the same initial deaths, with the Bee corporation still based in the UK. But, the events could, and should, have taken a global turn with deaths of other public figures and viral Internet stars happening over the course of weeks, all over the world. With Karin and Blue heading up the UK investigation, I would have liked to have seen an FBI agent involved, as well as police from China, Russia, and possibly even the UN as they figure out, together and/or separately, what is going on. And, the bee colonies could have easily been established worldwide. A very similar ending could have occurred, but on a global scale with tens of millions killed, even including public figures who would have used the DeathTo hashtag. The tribunal investigating the event could have been a multi-national one, again with Karin and other investigators questioned. I would have still liked to see Benedict Wong in the episode, perhaps as another nation's police representative.

I enjoyed this episode and found it strangely plausible, especially with (a) current rise (hopefully peak) of online hate propagandists and (b) the casualness of mass online hate.

5622,1516723069,7sfcbh,False,1,2,"So I've seen lots of people saying Metalhead is after Man On Fire. I have a different theory...

Metalhead - Dogs are released in a war/by accident. Europe gets hit very badly and America not so badly.

After Metalhead - The dogs slowly malfunction or are eliminated. America becomes a military dictatorship. Europe becomes a band of disheveled farmers.

Man On Fire - American dictatorship exterminates the roaches first in America, then Europe. The dictatorship needs war to continue to keep everything together, and to scapegoat someone for all the carnage. Autonomous military technology is banned, which is why this complicated Mass system is used. 

It explains a few things

- British people seem modern in Metalhead, but Danish (?) villagers in Man On Fire look like peasants
- The villagers believe the Roaches are contaminating their food supply, because their education levels are so low they believe these lies without the Mass brainwashing. It'd be harder to convince a person with a lot of knowledge from a pre-apocalypse time this.
- Rich man who killed himself in Metalhead. He did it somewhat recently, the house is in good order; and he's evidently not a roach since he's well-off.
- Cars that still work in Metalhead imply the apocalypse happened recently
- Why Mass isn't simply placed in drones. They have drones, they have technology that instantly recognises enemies (Roaches), but they want an actual human on the trigger
- The infrastructure in Metalhead looks recently abandoned, while Man On Fire; the infrastructure looks like Cherynobl. There are few windows left, inside buildings everything is rotted or destroyed.
- Man On Fire character commenting that the war in Europe lasted much longer than in America, which is why they have this roach problem. Since the soldiers are brainwashed about the roaches, why assume this is the same war? Maybe the roaches made a more convenient scapegoat than autonomous technology caused by humanities hubris. On the other hand, the natives know the Roaches didn't cause the war; but just suspect they cause disease; explaining why some help the Roaches.
- America becoming this horrific mass-implanting eugenics loving dictatorship is a big shift without explanation.",True,blackmirror,Man On Fire &amp; Metalhead Timeline

As I watched the episode it vaguely reminded me of a movie called the island which was based on the idea of cloning people as health precautions. 

As the episode progressed I realized they referenced ""doppels"" which had me to believe that they were the clones and why their lives were so secluded in buildings where they could only bicycle all day. They also mentioned how if they spent any of the merits, then the clothes, shoes, whatever would go to the ""doppel."" It would also explain why more obese people were treated worse because the clones are expected to stay in shape.

In this world the clones have rights which is why it seems they can still make their own choices in regards to entertainment, health habits, and even going onto television.

Of course it doesn't relate much to the movie but it follows loosely the idea where clones must be contained and not allowed to go to the outside world. Or at least that's what I gathered from the last scene where the protagonist is looking out the window as if feeling trapped.

I haven't watched all the way to Season 4 yet so for now, my favorite would be Playtest and least one is The Waldo Moment. 

In Playtest, even though it was too much to take and there were quite a few jumpscares (which I didn't really expect from seeing the previous episodes), the twists in the plot was just good that it made you feel a lot.

So after watching Black Museum, which featured the nice twist of the daughter of her tortured  tortured father avenging him by killing the man who did these atrocities to him, I got the song featured in the episode stuck in my head: “always there just to remind me”. Then I realized: 

This is symbolism about how the main character, Nish, has her mother still in her head via cookie/transferred consciousness post her own alleged suicide, guiding Nish through their revenge for their father and her life. Another line in the song, “you’ll always be a part of me” is a literal statement here: even after the destruction of her father causing her mother’s suicide, she’s still there, seeing all she sees and getting to communicate with her. 

I’m not sure if this is established, but even if it is, I can’t believe I was able to connect it on my own.

Nosedive - A pretty good, fun and entertaining episode. Though it doesn't really show what BM is about. I'd show it to someone first if I want to blindside them with something like SUAD afterwards, but I'm kind of concerned that by itself it wouldn't be a good intro.

Hang the DJ - A lot of people say its just like San Junipero, but the fact that it was 'just' a simulation in the end, one of a thousand, really killed a lot of the ""Happy Ending"" vibe for me.

You can add your own flair to this thread, since I feel like I could have missed some good plot information/side plot stories...

Around 2025 – The world has been Flu/Virus free for 5 years due to a new system of hygienic/sterilization programs that locates and eliminates possible dangers to your health. The thing is, these machines/programs simply tells a person who or what caused them to clean the area i.e. a sneeze that was not protect, cleaned up by person, ect. (People will have the ability to see this via their eyes, like in the The Entire History of You). The program is funded and created by the FDA and the CDC. The results of this program cause paranoia and people having OCD-like actions about cleanliness.

People tend to be more cautious of going out but it does not stop them from doing so. Life goes on as if there is nothing wrong. Although people seem to comply with this program, there is another option for people who choose not to go along with the program. The government calls this alternative program an “underground quarantine” but in reality it is where they get terminated, being sent to the core of the earth (as they would put it secretly).  This in return makes the world still no cases of flu or illness. 

Still in present day, people are starting to rebel. They think of ways to hack into the program and change the way these machines clean the environment. The couple who decides to move forward with this was anti-vaccine activist. Starting in 2017 posting all over the social media realms protesting people who force their kids and others into getting vaccinations.  Their goal is to get people back into the spectrum of getting to choose what you do with your hygiene and how you choose to defend your body with possible outbreaks. 

They hack into the system in an undocumented part of the city where there are rebels hiding and choosing to become “free of the government” though they quarantine themselves as if they were still living in 2017. They successfully hack into the code and modify it to where the machine’s program won’t tell why they’re cleaning and basically will focus on doing casual cleaning. 

Once people in the city are noticing things aren’t as “tidy” as they use to be, they start to panic. It starts uproar as people become more paranoid about a possible outbreak. Carry on about a week later, it is starting to become a internet sensation and all over the news that the city is becoming un-sanitized and people should prepare for the worst. Markets are being bombarded for cleaning supplies, spending ungodly amounts on products that they once didn’t need due to the FDA and CDC’s program.

As people become hermit to the outside world, they forget to care about themselves. They are not eating, drinking or bathing due to fear of being contaminated. The FDA and CDC catch on to what is happening in this particular city (similar to New York, Chicago, LA) and now can carry on to their original resolution to this possible case…vaccinations. 

Once agencies of this particular city start propaganda about vaccinations, more and more people are worried that this will spread to all over the country (USA). People continue to watch on to see what will happen to this city. No-one is wanting to travel, there are basically travel bans (like we are hearing about now) and people are trying to live without trying to get out of the house (even robotic-delivery-type machines are programmed to not enter the city). The couple who started this pandemic are dead, they went out once to see what the city looked liked and caught a hybrid-virus/flu that killed them within days (due to no medicine/vaccines to cure it). Once this gets out the FDA/CDC they make it a point to set an example about getting vaccinated due to a possible illness that is lethal. 

In the end, since no-one could come in and help this city due to a possible outbreak…it turns into a Depression-like state. People aren’t going to work due to paranoia and don’t want to get infected. Doctor’s (who are simply robots) are giving vaccinations left and right to people because they believe (and trust) that this is the answer. Not knowing that the FDA/CDC revive the program and everything is back to “normal” and they plan to not make an announcement to other cities due to them getting money from insurances and making a 500% profit from them.  This city will be forever known as a poor-country and they have to live in a bubble-like state since news outside of the city have called these people ‘living-breathing zombies”.

5680,1516642316,7s7d0c,False,46,71,"It's a little weak, (and a tad long) but I have a theory about the hideously inaccurate casting of Sara in ""Arkangel"". Watching it, I had no issues with the actress. I thought she was really good, and I just assumed it was Dawson casting. She didn't look that much like a teenager, but I presumed her to be 17, maybe 18.

People have been joking that the missing 'classic Black Mirror' from the episode was that she was supposed to be 15 and was clearly fucking not. But maybe that is the twist.

Think about how often we're given a character to empathise with, only to be told later of their darkest secrets ( Kenny; Shut Up and Dance, Victoria; White Bear, Matt &amp; Potter; White Christmas etc.)  Our gut reactions do a complete shift when we get another piece of the puzzle.

I mean, why mention her age at all? She's clearly in high school/secondary education, old enough to want to have sex and do drugs, but young enough to hide it from her mother. We don't really need to know exactly how old she is tbh. Unless that's the whole point of the lesson. 

Up until the age reveal, you watch it thinking that the mother has serious boundary issues. It made sense to want to watch over her child when she was younger, but it's just creepy now. She's spying on her child and invading her privacy in the cruellest ways. The mother is totally in the wrong, right?

But skip to the reveal. She's only 15? For a lot of people watching (parents and older siblings most likely) they may have felt their reactions shift just a little bit. My sister is 15. I wouldn't want to see a birds eye view of her life, but I would absolutely freak the fuck out if she was doing coke, breaking curfew and banging discount Kylo Ren. 

Her being 15 makes us uncomfortable because it's just that perfect age where you still legally have little say in your life, are likely still as dumb as a box of rocks, but also are definitely not a child anymore. A 14 year old is more clearly a child, and a 16 year old is closer to being an adult, but 15 is that terribly awkward age of ambiguity. 

Brooker and co wanted us to clearly see her as an adult (because there is no way that actress could pass for 15 irl) up until that moment so that it could perfectly juxtapose her mother seeing her as a fragile, innocent child. Then they pull the rug from under us both because she's neither. When the mother screams that Sara is 15, the audience and the mother are meeting in the middle with the horrible realisation about their perspectives. For the mother, it's that her 'baby' is growing up rapidly, and for the audience, it's that this young woman is still in many ways a child. While the mother had over done it on the helicopter parenting, we were silently approving the 'adultification' of a child.  

I don't mean to try and preach that the mother's surveillance was right, (because it was super fucked up) but the age shift forces a lot of viewers to reconsider their judgement of the mother. She was still completely out of line in her later actions, but they make a bit more sense now. It shows at the end, where we see Sara climb into a truck with a stranger. Whereas before we had rooted for her independence from her clingy mother, we were now concerned for her safety, because after all, she's only 15. ",True,blackmirror,She's 15?

The reason why they didn't want the cellphone turned on was so it wouldn't interfere with their equipment. Since he left his phone on and his Mom called him during the uploading process, it completely fried his brain. Then I noticed several things that are very clever! When the phone first rings during the uploading process it says ""5:38PM"" on it. When we see him at the very end of the episode and the women is reaching for the phone that is ringing that says ""Mom"" on it and a time of ""5:38PM"". That's why when she's filling out the paper work under ""Test Duration"" it says: ""0.04 seconds"". The seizure that he was having basically caused him to have that ""fake reality"". Everything from the wack a mole to the point the women is picking up his cellphone at the very end of the episode was all created by the seizure. Or perhaps a better tech way of explaining it is that his ""firmware update"" failed and he became a ""brick"". There's also a clock in the white room to function as a piece to confirm the time that had passed. The clock at the beginning of the white room and at the end both say 5:38PM. You can also notice a strange interference noise while the phone vibrates in both instances of her picking up the phone. That interference noise is there to let you know exactly when his brain was fried.

There's a bunch of other very clever things throughout the episode like in the beginning he's watching a movie with a giant spider on a building.

At the start of the San Junipero, Kelly mentioned how she likes Yorkie's unfashionable glasses because they showed she's authentic. At the end of the episode, after Yorkie passes over, the writer deliberately included a scene where, upon entering SJ for the first time since her passing, Yorkie frolicks on a beach and ditches her glasses--the exact same glasses that Kelly thinks makes her authentic. [This was emphasized by a long still-shot of the abandoned glasses](https://i.imgur.com/6fymcVK.jpg). Yorkie was never shown wearing those glasses again.

I think this was Brooker's way of acknowledging the consciousness uploading problem--an ""uploaded"" consciousness cannot be a continuation of the original (at least, not using the method depicted here). The Yorkie we saw in SJ after her passing was not the authentic Yorkie. The same holds true for every full-time resident of San Junipero.

Contrary to what most ""hardcore"" Black Mirror fans might tell you, Charlie Brooker delivered a true Black Mirror episode and a textbook case of [Fridge Horror](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror). Hats off to Brooker for creating something that, at first glance, is uplifting enough and widely-appealing enough to win an Emmy, yet deeply disturbing and depressing when scrutinized.

Yorkie died and never went to heaven *despite expecting to*; Kelly died and never went to heaven *despite expecting to*: nobody can become a full-time resident in San Junipero, yet the false hope given by this perfect illusion of pleasure and immortality is tantalizing enough to encourage euthanasia.

My vision for the show would be something like this:
The team sets off throughout the Infinity, exploring different areas and things that no one could even imagine from just playing the game at their house.  The ultimate antagonist would be Daly himself, because I don't think it was ever 100% confirmed that he died at the end of the show.  Operating under the assumption that he did not die, in the pilot someone would realize that Daly isn't communicating with anyone and end up rescuing him (it would be extremely spectacular if this someone was actually the real life Nanette, because afterall, what does she really have against Daly at this point other than that he seems a bit weird, and had some weird things in his fridge?), setting up his role in trying to eliminate the USS Callister from the Infinity.

Why did I even start this series? Well, it's been praised as a great series. So I wanted to see what it was about. But I am not happy... Wikipedia and IMDB did not prepare me for this. 

A series' first episode should tell me what it's about. It was the UK PM fucking a pig on live TV. Okay, I could *not* go to bed with that in my mind. Let's see if S1E2 is better? It was a prison built of TV screens and video games. Some dude riding a spinning bike in order to watch lesbian porn? That's when I turned it off.

People can watch whatever they want. I am not telling them not to. But I fail to understand how this series was so impressive that they made four seasons of it.

Please folks, help me out here: why do you watch this? What makes it ""worth it"" to you? Did you have the same initial thoughts as I have told above? *What the hell is the point here??*

Personally, I see myself as someone who would use it, even for intermittent use.

I have an older sister who's a prime example of a crazy bitch. She sees/perceives things in a negative way, bullies our youngest sister by making her do chores, mocks people including me in a very insensitive way, throws hysterical fits most often than not and other bitchy stuff. One colleague of mine even know her as someone who bitch-slaps people in school.

Anyway, living with her was tough, but I managed to do it by 'blocking' her most of the time. Whenever she's around at home, I'd put my headphones hurriedly and turn up the volume of my music just so I could be immersed in my own world and forget about her. I rarely start a conversation with her since high school up to now. The most comfortable way for me to talk to her is via texting. She never changed up to now. My mother even have a 5-year (and counting) grudge with her. They don't talk to each other even though they live under the same roof.

Now, fast forward to present, I am already working. But I think I already developed the habit of 'blocking' people. I use it for my rare douche workmates.

And I think I also reaching a point of apathy for people. For example, if I was Lacie in Nosedive, I wouldn't really consider Nae Nae as a best friend. I wouldn't even be friends with her in social media. People who belittle their friends are not friends; they are bullies. 

With all that said, I just want to let this things out, as I realized that these experiences were heavily related to the 'Block' feature.

Local Government Denmark - the associtation and interest organisation of the 92 Danish municipalities – has released a 202 page analysis on how new technologies such as artificial intelligence, big data and robots, iOT, virtual reality, and augmented reality can be used in the everyday lives of the municipalities' citizens.

It includes a number of visions: What if...

* all parents can know all details about their childrens' development, results and well-being in real-time

* we can predict, before children turn 6, how they will fare in life - who will be successful and who will be cost-intensive

* voice services like Alexa can ""listen along"" and track bullying and abuse as it occurs

* all contact between elderly and municipality employees can be handled through robots and chat bots

* all citizens can diagnose themselves 24/7

* citizens can earn coins/merits by doing social work

* grades are saved on a blockchain so they always follow the student, cannot be tampered with, and do not require verification by a third party

* citizens are willing to give away their data to commercial actors for better diagnosis or services

* the appraisal of a student's eligibility to a certain education can be automated

* the municipality has access to all data – anonymized – through its citizens' phones

* the municipality can predict destructive behavior from a citizen – through analysis of data from the infrastructure in the municipality – before the act is performed (own abuse, abuse of others, or violence ...)

I've already started noticing a trend with the technology used, as it seems as though some of it is EXTREMELY close in concept.  There were 2 that jumped out immediately to me...

San Junipero and USS Callister - Seems like the tech used in both these episodes are incredibly similar.  Both temple-based mind altering VR.

White Christmas and Archangel - Both seem to use chip imbedded surveillance.

Was just curious if there has at all been any times from episode to episode?  Could this be a potential Cloverfield-esque universe?

For a duration of time, the story was reality for me. I was thinking ""This must be how experimental technologies and medical advances are created - I wonder how many experiments have gone awry like this in the real world, and you never hear about it because it gets hushed and covered"".

By the point where Dawson was essentially mutilating himself, I was completely absorbed. I was so terrified that when the scenery went back to the museum a few minutes later, I realized I was sweating waterfalls.

This show is so freaking intense, especially because you never know what you'll get. I was expecting to get high and get mindfucked by something like San Junipero, USS Callister or Hang the DJ, instead i got sent into a realm of insanity and waking nightmares.

Thanks, Black Mirror!",True,blackmirror,"I made the mistake of watching ""Black Museum"" while stoned. Jesus Christ..."
5924,1516372878,7riq58,False,17,42,"San Junipero gets the top spot - there's no villain except Yorkie's offscreen family, the main characters aren't ethically compromised, kindness is frequently displayed, and the technology is only used to help people during this episode.

That isn't all true for USS Callister - Daly is a horrible person using technology to do horrible things.

But where this differs from your average Black Mirror episode is this is an anomaly. Daly is just an individual, and his misuse of technology isn't institutional or approved by society, as it is in 15 Million Merits or White Bear, for example - in fact, it's actually illegal. Nor is it an obvious and likely common outcome of the technological product - as is the case in The Entire History Of You, Be Right Back, or ArkAngel. In fact, Daly had had to jump through quite a lot of hoops to transform the original, innocent video game into something where he could do such harm.

Finally, if we remove Daly from the equation, the episode presents the same bright view of humanity that San Junipero did. The main characters are largely not morally compromised in any way - Walton was, so far as we know, the only one who'd done anything more than be mildly rude in the real world. Despite their cynicism and sometimes acerbic natures, they work well together and display kindness and selflessness. This is even on display in the real world, most prominently with Lowry making overtures of friendship towards Nanette and warning her that something seems off about Daly, and that Walton would fuck anything that moved.

6008,1516296829,7rbcwb,False,7,23,"This is my way of connecting a lot of the episodes of black mirror . Before you start reading I just want to say that I do realize that there are other references to other episodes within these episodes but I'm just going to pretend like theses are the only ones that are on this timeline. A lot of this is just me filling in the blanks btw but i do feel like what i fill in fits. This timeline I'll call the darkest timeline, as it is probally the darkest timeline of any timeline presented in black mirror. 

To establish the central technology of The darkest timeline i'll starts with hated in the nation's news headline that says that the us government approved the use of MASS, or implanted AR tech, on their military personnel, based on the relatively low tech in the episode this is around 2025. This tech is also implemented on children through the archangel program around the same time. So basically archangel/MASS tech is the central technology of this timeline and is one of the main problems in the timeline.

 Now onto the main events of the timeline, it starts with the deaths of the 300,000 in hated in the nation.  These deaths sends the UK into political and social ruin. Allowing the popular Waldo party to take control of the country and restabalize it. They began their rule over the UK as a party that care for the people and helped them recover quickly. But just as quickly as they repaired England the became a very elitist and tyrannical government. They completely throw away the court system and instead persecute people based on how ever it pleases them and they persecute them in horrible ways, for example their persecution of Victoria in white bear. Shortly before they become that tyrannical government They also put back in place the archangel tech in every citizen  which when they became the tyranny they did, they used it to censor and control the UK population. 

 Over the next twelve years years through implementing their political party into every major government of the world through extortion, lying, and censoring their opposition they effectively conquered the world. Now in 2037 With the archangel/MASS tech fully integrated into the population they also introduce a slightly advanced memory technology similar too the tech from entire history of you and added it to their means of control. This made the population even more so compliant to the regieme bullshit 

But after about a year of memory wiping, in 2038 a small but sizable amount of people started to notice gaps in their consciousness leading them to realizing the other censorships placed on them so they revolt and spark the war mentioned ten years prior to men against fire. There are heavy losses on both sides of the war, the few million people, who realized what their government actually was doing, and the Waldo regieme. 

But after a year of intense digital and physical warfare on both sides it's the government that wins the war. Although, The waldo regieme was forced to split into about 5 massive countries that kept all the ideals of the Waldo regieme except Waldo. They also erased the idea of waldo from everyones mind so he couldnt trigger any memories of the waldo regieme. The new government's of the world were also much more subtle and careful in their control. You see this subtle control in white Christmas through their use of blocks to disconnect people they don't want in society from it. As for the normal population that didn't see through the Waldo party's censorships they lived through the war and experienced it but how they remembered it was much different. They remembered it as a war between the roaches and their respective government not the Waldo regieme. 

So after the war the government's of the world hunted down the ""roaches"" with the MASS program. This takes about thirty years for all the ""roaches"", who aren't even the revolutionaries anymore but more so just the poor and weak people of the world, to be eradicated from the earth. During these 30 years the government's of the world also get the world ready for rating system by erasing people's minds of anything bad and just purifying the world with technology. 

So by 2069 the MASS program is retired, world peace from the roaches is declared, and the rating system is fully put into play. From 2069-2084 the world lived in a hellish utopia where anyone who dropped below one on the rating chart becomes a roach and is killed. The duty of killing ""roaches"" soon enough became the job of mobile kill droids nicknamed ""dogs"". So when the system was hacked in 2085 and everyone became a 0 the droids killed almost everyone creating the dystopian landscape of metalhead.",True,blackmirror,Connecting some of the episodes

A lonely and depressed man named John can never get a date no matter how hard he tries and lives a depressed single life. He works a dead-end office job, but really wants to be a writer. He agrees to be part of a lab experiment for a company for a new piece of technology considering they'll pay him for his time and he has nothing better to do. John tries the experiment and meets with Dr Sheila Brown who'll be working with him. John tries the brain scanning piece of technology, but things go wrong, and it has to be aborted before harming the his brain. He gets paid anyway, however. 

Afterwards, he stumbles across a woman while out in public grocery shopping named Caitlin, and the two have instant chemistry and common interests. She is attracted to him, and the two start dating despite John's disbelief. Caitlin works a pretty well-paying job and inspires John to pursue his dreams of being a book author. Caitlin is so influential, she encourages John to be a better man and instills confidence in him. However, things seem to be a little weird in John's life. Things seem to be going too well, unlike his usual life where he is a magnet for bad luck. 

As it turns out, Caitlin tells him that this life isn't real and that she has to go. John doesn't want her to go though, and tries to make her stay. He wakes up inside the lab, greeting by Dr Brown, having realized the entire thing was literally just a dream. Dr Brown tells John the experiment was a success. He asks what does she mean, and she reminds him why he came in: he wanted to become a better person. John's time spent with Caitlin inside the dream allowed him to know exactly how to become just that. However, knowing that Caitlin wasn't real has left John worse off than before, as he had the love of his life but lost her. He contemplates suicide by jumping off a rooftop on a rainy night, but decides not to, at the last minute, thinking of his time with Caitlin inside the dream. It's enough for him to rethink his thoughts. He decides to go home and continue to write, following his dream to be an author. 

At the end, someone contacts Dr Brown, saying how they want to go back to the lab again, and that someone is Caitlin in the real world. As it turns out, the people inside the dream weren't just fictional, but rather, other participants for the company, just in different rooms from each other. An intern comes in, addressing Dr Brown, but she says that everyone calls her by her nickname instead, ""Coach.""

Secondly, since ratings are made on phones, you could steal them to manipulate your score. Something like stealing, rating and then wiping or destroying the phone should work.

Dead zones for mobile networks would make it impossible to rate an individual in real time. This could have people forgetting to rate you. Of course this is about remote areas where rankings are limited.

I also can't see a reason people wouldn't pay for good ratings. That seems like it would be an offered service. Probably minimal but like a monthly subscription say $50 a month for a group support of similair individuals. Say 100 local citizens all supporting eachother and either an intermediary or just group benefits. Just a daily grind even in the city can't equate to more than a few dozen.

When Amy and Frank meet at the beginning of the episode it's established that both parties have to tap at the same time to reveal the expiry date (Amy says so before they do it on their first date).  But when Frank breaks their promise and decides to reveal the end date he doesn't have to steal her little coach pod thing to do it, he just taps on his own and it reveals the time.  I was super confused when he went to do it, but thought maybe I was just misremembering the beginning.  However, as he goes to click on his coach they show a close up of it and it clearly says on the screen ""Tap to Reveal: both parties must tap at the same time"" (timestamp 33:59). 

Seems like they could have easily gotten around this if they just edited out the line of dialogue from the beginning and changed the text displayed on the coach screen, so why didn't they?  Was this an intentional ""mistake"" meant to plant the seed that the system's rules weren't actually going to be enforced like they discover at the end?  Or maybe the AI decides to allow him to see the date without mutual consent as an excuse to ""recalibrate"" and take away their time together, pushing Frank in the direction of rebelling against the system that took something away from him that he deeply cared about?  But it seems like the episode doesn't really acknowledge that it's breaking its own rules - no justification is given as to why Frank would think he'd be allowed to reveal the time without the other party's consent.

Now, this might seem like common knowledge: “yea, he represents the obsessed fandom of old shows” “he took his anger out of his real life coworkers on their digital clones” and while that’s all true this is actually a response to Cristin Miloti (Cole’s actress, also being the main character), describing the main character as “misogynistic”. 

Now, while he did have a sort of trophy wife kiss from each girl after each mission, I believe this is all on purpose to show that he isn’t sexist, but following the trends of Space Fleet, the show his mod is based on for this version of Infinity. 

We can recognize that he seems to order around the black character to get him coffee, and forcefully kisses each girl, BUT seeing as space fleet, a show that he said were on VHR’s and were older then himself, must be pretty far into the past and seeing as it’s a Star Trek Clone, at a time where these roles for these races and genders were still very stuck in stereotypical places of being sex objects or servers. I think all Daly was doing was replicating his shows tropes  to make him “live out his dream”, hence the lack of genitalia and other elements that were probably never in space fleet. 

Daly was a bad person and took out the anger he had for his coworkers by doing much worse things to their digital counterparts, such as what he did to Tommy, but he wasn’t a sexist: just a lonely man with a dark side in reaction to being bullied and an outcast.!

6106,1516199957,7r1ddd,False,0,4,"Hey all, just wanted to share my thoughts and get your thoughts on the season. 

**1: USS Callister** - I like this episode as a whole, I think that it started the season strong despite riffing off of a concept that's been used many times - the copies/cookies. I also found myself getting distracted looking up the known actors. It was cool seeing some actors I knew, but I spent a few minutes looking them up on IMDB to verify how I knew them. **8/10**

**2: Arkangel** - A solid episode all things considered, but it felt far too simple/straightforward for a Black Mirror episode. The technology hadn't been used, but it's similar enough to tech in previous episodes to give a trend of thought for me that the writers are starting to figure out things to write about. There was no twist here, I think most viewers had some idea of how things were going to turn out, perhaps not specifically, but the episode was rather straightforward. **6.75/10**

**3: Crocodile** - I found this episode to be largely forgettable and my least favorite of the series. The only memorable thing for me was that it was filmed in Iceland. The twist at the end was...well alright. I dunno, I didn't find anything compelling about it. I thought the memory extracting concept was cool, but I felt the ending to be a little, ""Oh, yeah, okay...well sure that happened."" I probably wouldn't watch this one again, it felt weak from start to finish. **5/10**

**4: Hang the DJ** - This was truly the first in the season where I felt like the writers finally nailed a new concept. I love the concept of there's being simulations in order to find your perfect match % on a dating site. It was a cute episode of a couple who were destined to be together and as someone who met my girlfriend on OkCupid it resonated with me. It was the San Junipero of the season and quite frankly I liked it even more. This is quintessential Black Mirror and in my opinion the strongest and most creative episode of the season. **10/10**

**5: Metahead** - If I never watch this episode again I'm okay with that. I liked the gritty grindhouse quality to it, I liked the idea of this fucked up world where these robots are killing machines with a sole purpose to destroy any humans they see. I get that the point was to show how much these people were willing to risk just to find a bit of humanity left in the world, but as a Black Mirror episode it just didn't jive with me. Perhaps if they had made the episode a bit longer, or released it separate of Black Mirror I would have had different expectations, but I just wasn't a fan. **5.5/10**

**6: Black Museum** - This is the season's White Christmas and while it's a quirky episode with some interesting concepts, many of them feel rushed/half-baked. So they can transfer the woman's consciousness into another person's mind to share it, and they can transfer it into a stuffed animal, but they can't put it into anything that she can control? The pain/pleasure thing story was an interesting concept though, it felt Palahniuk inspired. The twist of the episode felt like Black Mirror, but it felt too derivative of White Christmas the end transferring of minds concept feels like their go-to when they hit a creative writing block. **8/10**

-In the 5 target plates is a symbol from another BM episode, White Bear.

-The gopher is from the video game he was playing on the plane.

-The gopher game music is from the same game.

-The little spider was from a guy's shirt in the game studio.

-The fireplace is from a game being played in the studio.

-The fire just spontaneously starts like he's in a game or his memory lapses. Did he start the fire? Did we even see any firewood, supplies, or matches, etc?

-The giant spider is from the tv on the plane.

-The creepy guy was in a game being played by a girl in the game studio., and he just stands there like when the girl was customizing him in the game.

-The ceo's office is decorated with pictures of a psilocybin mushroom, even though Cooper pretends not to get the reference.

-The psilocybin mushroom is separated into 3 pieces, like his screwed up connection.

-At the end of the psilocybin mushroom in the painting is a neural netting / roots described by 'Katie' later.

-The ceo fondly described a gaming experience like a psilocybin mushroom experience.

-The ceo described gaming as a good experience because the player is still alive... as opposed to Cooper who isn't actually playing a game so he is going to die.

-The cord connected the his head/mushroom in the second chair is a cell phone charger cord, referencing both cell phones and that his connection should have been hardwired to begin with.

-The cell phone cord connects to his mushroom even though there isn't a port on it.

-Heart rate increases are mentioned by both the ceo and katie in his dream and he probably has tachycardia while he's dying.

-You hear cell phone vibrations ever since he gets to the horror house (though I wonder why he wouldnt hear them during the gopher game too).

-There are three versions of the horror house - the one in the painting at the studio, the actual horror house in his dream, and the painting of the horror house inside the horror house. They are all similar but different with different amounts of windows, chimney positions, trees, etc. 

-The final painting of the horror house inside the horror house looks ugly and degraded like a fading memory.

-The light and the man go on inside the painting because they were there in the painting at the studio.

-The man is not like the painting in the studio though and is more like the creepy man who pops up in the horror house shortly afterwards.

-The stairway to the final room in the horror house is the same layout as the stairway to his mom's room, same camera angle, and 3 doors at the end.

-He complains about 'more stairs' - why there be unexpected stairs in reality? The stairs could also be in reference to climbing stairs at the studio.

-There is a statue of his mom's face just outside the final room, and also another place in the house.

-The room is laid out just like his mom's room with similar positions of the bed, pillows, door, mirror, lamp, etc.

-When he cant remember things in the room.. It could be due to the fear of altzeimers or it could be due to brain death.

-He was right that his mom was going to be in the room, just not the horror house version of it.

-Both plane rides (real and imaginary) have issues with turning off electronic devices.

-Katie's voice tells him that people like to hear a voice to make them feel like theyre not alone even though they are. That's what she is... (shes not real)

-Mom is a constant theme throughout the entire episode, probably because the contact name 'Mom' is spamming his head with the cell signal.

-The end of his dream (but before mom) starts containing things that are actually going on around him, like seeing the japanese guy and hearing japanese and knowing that the simulation was under a second.

-The tinder hookup girl actually DID kill him, because she's the one who asked him to take pictures.

-The first time his mom calls him is at 6:16AM. The second nueral net upload in the dream commences at 6:17PM

6129,1516171560,7qz7kn,False,20,5,"~~~ 1\. First of all, **they're based on real people.**

The primary difference between Space Fleet and a normal video game is that the ""cast"" of USS Callister is composed of a bunch of real-life people, specifically chosen. Gunning down or torturing random NPCs is one thing. Doing the same to someone who is an exact copy of someone you know in real life?!? That's something else entirely...

I got a lot of voyeurism vibes from the whole DNA-stealing thing. A related ethical issue I've seen on Reddit before is guys jerkin' it to photos from a girl's social media. Much worse when they're photos taken without said girl's permission, as said by the whole ""creepshots"" subreddit(s) fiasco. 

You see the connection I'm making here? If people are opposed to upskirts, then they are *sure as FUCKING shit* going to be opposed to someone raping a conscious copy of someone in a virtual world. That's a line even the most lewd of video games don't cross. 

***

~~~ 2\. Second of all, **I think someone who takes pleasure from torturing conscious beings is slightly a *lot* messed up.**

People forget a lot of factors when taking into account whether they would commit violent or psychologically torturous acts against a conscious AI. 

Unless you spend your free time enjoying the suffering of *real* people dying on Liveleak or whatever, then your experience of murdering people comes from movies - in the secondhand - or video games. These aren't accurate portrayals of a person's response to murder, at all. Both cases are most often poorly acted, unrealistically animated, or otherwise doing something to break your suspension of disbelief. 

Also, tying into my first point, these are based on *real people*. Really, would you have *zero fucking response* to witnessing a perfect simulation of someone you know getting brutally murdered? I know more often it's someone you dislike, but out there is going to be people doing it to someone you like, and to *you*. 

We have yet to see anyone meet their own Cookie. I really think watching your Cookie get brutally tortured, raped, and murdered while they beg for your help (and knowing everything you know; you saw how Cole callously threatened and manipulated her real-life self), beg for your mercy... Really? You'd just smile, look up, and say ""lol, just code, play it again"", maybe getting out some popcorn? 

***

~~~ 3. Third of all, **callousness towards Cookies isn't that much different from the way extreme racists think, and it entirely forgets our core components.**

""They're code, they're not *real* people."" ""They're black, they're not *real* people."" The Japanese, at least during WWII, saw the Chinese as subhuman, and thus were able to commit horrible things such as the Rape of Nanking, or testing biological weapons on Chinese civilian populations. 

The human body is entirely composed of cells. Guess the *fuck* what? Cells aren't alive. That's right. **CELLS.** **AREN'T.** **ALIVE.** Blowing your nose probably kills millions of cells, we don't really empathize with them. They are just a bunch of chemical reactions, guided by ""code"" (DNA long-term and RNA short-term). I don't know much about cell biology, but I do know that we aren't thinking of ourselves as committing genocide whenever we bust a nut.

Why does a human matter and a Cookie not just because a human is made of cells and a Cookie is made of transistors? If a person gets a pacemaker, would you care less if they died? Would you disown your kid if he got too many transistor implants?

**TL;DR - If you are unable to empathize with something simply based on being told it's code, then you're missing something in your perspective, or have psychopathic traits.**",False,blackmirror,"There are three things that make Cookie-technology ethically wrong, even though it's just code and a copy."

The first episode starts off strong I loved everything about the concept and how fleshed out it was and the story was well written and then it just kinda tappers off from there. Arkangel had a really interesting realistic concept with obvious negatives but the plot just kind of fell on its face and it was predictable. Then there's was crocodile where I found that to be just kinda dumb like dark just to be dark. Hang the DJ was kind of a contradiction in the message I mean the  couple turn to rebel the system only to be a simulation to match the couple in real life? Wasn't the message that the simulation was bad? Metal head was just meh in my opinion not much to say there. Now black museum how ever  was pretty good, the overarching story was entertaining for what it was and interesting and the first two sub plots had some interesting and grim stories  but when it got the third story it just kind of fell on its face because I was thinking this is just the sadistic version of white Christmas or San Juneapero and then it turns to be a revenge plot I mean it was kind of cool but like it just was mixed messages like why did the daughter have the mother installed in her head? Didn't the episode just tell us that a relationship like that with that system would be extremely complicated and will not work out? And the ethical issues.

Now, I'm not going to contend that CollegeHumor even holds a candle to Charlie Brooker and the Black Mirror team, or even that all of the episodes are top quality, but there are a few highlights that I think make the show worth viewing on a free trial. 
###Table of Contents
Episode|Synopsis|Should you watch it?
:--|:--|:--
1. Which of the ""Friends"" are you?|It's Divergent re-told through Buzzfeed quizzes|Skip, it's pretty weak and falls apart halfway through
2. Amazon Foresight| An Amazon power user signs up for Amazon's new ""Foresight"" service, which mines all of your personal information to pre-purchase exactly what you need.|Must watch. it's a 21st century version of the spiteful genie with a twist
3. Your Search History Revealed|Hackers reveal every person's internet search history, and the episode follows a family of four who have to come to terms with each other|Come back. Oscar Nuñez (Oscar from The Office) plays the dad, which is nice, and the background chaos (two news reporters look at each others' on-air, the president keeps getting impeached) is pretty funny. Unfortunately, I don't think they pushed the envelope as far as it could go when it came to the actual content of the searches.
4. Youtube Death Battle Showdown|A small-time YouTuber joins the annual Death Battle Showdown, a Hunger Games-style battle royale for subscribers. She gets caught in a crossfire between make-up tutorial, cooking, gaming, and sketch comedy YoutTubers|Come back. The YouTuber archetypes in this one are pretty good, especially Smosh's role as a once-popular comedy channel that have now been reduced to bad jokes about twerking and constant book/tour plugs. The story itself is almost kinda White Bear with our protagonist caught in a deadly game. Not the strongest episode if you don't care about YouTube personalities, but not the worst either. 
5. The Seven Billionth Wheel| A guy signs up for ""Soulmate"", the dating app that is guaranteed to find someone for everyone. Unfortunately, there seems to be no match for him, among all of humanity, hence ""the seven billionth wheel"". Is there a more analog way to find love, even in this digital era?|Must watch. This is one of the most Black Mirror episodes of the series, bringing to mind episodes like Hang the DJ and San Junipero, with a little hint of Nosedive. Will Arnett is brilliant, like always, as the CEO of Soulmate, and the ending of the episode is almost Brooker-level, with the whole unfitting music played over something dark/shocking.
6. The Year-Long Ad Experience| A couple is offered a Faustian deal: In exchange for never having to view another commercial for life, they must sit through a 1-year ad for Chompsky's brand kettle chips. The only problem is that the ad is fully immersive VR, and they might end up going crazy before they get out.|Must watch. White Christmas, Playtest, basically all of the cookie episodes rolled into one. The humor in this one is pretty rock-solid throughout, including my favorite exchange(spoilers, I guess): P:""Every happy emotion, every memory, they're all tied to those potato chips now."" E:""That's sick."" P:""No. That's...advertising.""E: ""Okay, cool it, we know you took a semester in Philosophy.""
7. The President Goes Viral|An asteroid is about to strike the Earth, and America's only hope for survival is to make it to the giant bunkers built for just such an occurrence. Unfortunately, the president is having a bit of trouble getting her message across. Man, going viral on YouTube just isn't as easy as it used to be.|Come back. The episode is surprisingly good, it's just not one of the episodes that you need to watch. The plot is pretty straightforward, no major twists or anything, but there are decent jokes and writing.
8. Uber, but like, for people| A new app lets people who are strapped for cash rent out their sleeping bodies to perform tasks for exploitatively low pay. The episode follows a guy who relies on apps like these to afford crashing on his sister's couch instead of getting a job.|Come back. Obviously an indictment of these Uber and AirBnB style services that treat their ""employees"", for lack of a better word, as expendable cogs in a great machine. I don't know how to feel about this episode, because I think it has some great scenes related to the message, that are distracted from by some of the jokey-er scenes.
9. Secrets of the Mom Web|You ever wonder where moms get those pseudo-memes that you always see in emails and on facebook, but never find anywhere on the internet? One son is about to find out from his mother just how deep the rabbit hole goes.|Come back. The conceit of the episode is pretty far-fetched, and besides the Buzzfeed one this is the furthest from Black Mirror that the series gets. There isn't really any commentary on technology or society besides ""Where do those Facebook memes come from?"" What prevents me from telling you to skip the episode entirely is the sheer absurdity of it.
10. Enter the Hivemind|Don't you just hate how out of touch your grandparents are when it comes to technology? Like how your grandpa doesn't even know what model neural implant he's running and has never connected to the hivemind before? This story follows a young woman trying to introduce her luddite grandfather to the social-media-on-steroids lunacy of the hivemind.|Must watch. This episode could honestly belong in BM if the idea was fleshed out a little more and made into a full-length story. If you've ever wondered what it will look like when our generation are the out-of-touch ones, this is what you want. Highlights include the grandfather complaining that kids today don't hang out by sitting around silently on their phones like they used to back in the good old days. Seriously, just watch the episode, it's easily the best.

###Conclusion
I really think you should give Bad Internet a shot. The longest episode is only 13 minutes, and the rest range around 10 apiece, so it's pretty easy to binge it all in an afternoon. Based on my own opinions, you should watch anything I rated ""Must watch"" first, then follow this order for the ""Come back"" episodes:

- Uber
- President
- YouTube Death Battle
- Mom Web
- Search History

Finally, I'm begging you, *please* don't watch the ""Which 'Friend' are you?"" episode first. Even though it is technically free even without YouTube Red, it is not at all indicative of the quality of the series, and I would forgive anyone who watched that first for skipping the rest of this fun Black Mirror substitute.

**TL;DR:**Watch Bad Internet on YouTube Red, it's good enough to sate that Black Mirror craving for a while. But, for the love of God, skip the first episode entirely, even if it is a free preview episode. Just get a YouTube Red free trial and enjoy.

6173,1516135345,7qvdib,False,4,8,"Calling Hang the DJ ""San Junipero for The Straights"" isn't quite accurate. San Junipero was deeply interested in its characters, they have backstories and intricate personalities. Hang the DJ is far simpler, a presentation of larger than life emotions. This is in no way a negative in my opinion, I loved the episode just like everyone else. 

However, I took a read from the ending that I haven't seen anyone else take. A few people have said that it's not as feel-good as the tone suggests, bringing thousands of conscious beings into existence only to wipe them away, but I see it differently. At the end of Hang the DJ, the AI agents discover their true greater purpose before dying peacefully. 

I don't consider myself religious, but I was raised in a Catholic household. Honestly, I couldn't see this episode as anything other than a thinly veiled metaphor for faith and finding meaning in faith. Frank and Amy are thrust into a seemingly chaotic and nonsensical universe, but discover at the end that it all had meaning in letting the real Frank and Amy find each other. The ending comes across as happy because most of us wish we could find that kind of meaning, knowing for sure that we are a part of something bigger. The AI rebelling the system despite physical threats is very much like following a holy text and believing in an afterlife despite lack of evidence. God dares us to believe he exists in the same way the dating app dares Frank and Amy to rebel together.

It isn't just that Black Mirror gets dark, but that the episodes end without catharsis.  It leaves us with the haunted look of the PM's wife in ""National Anthem"", the emptiness of ""15 Million Merits"", or the horror that ""White Bear"" is repeated every day.   

But S04, for the most part, does deliver us that catharsis.

USS Calister - Bad guy dies, good guys make their triumphant escape.

Arkangel - Daughter successfully escapes toxic family situation. 

Crocodile - Ends with the murderer being arrested, like any good crime drama. 

Hang the DJ - Love Wins 998/1000 times 

Metalhead - This feels more like Black Mirror.  For a while I was worried that the protagonist would find some ex machina way to beat the Dogs. 

Black Museum - The ultimate righteous revenge story.   

I have mixed feelings.  On the one hand, catharsis feels good, there's a reason it has been a rule for tragedy going back 2500 years.  Watching these stories makes me feel good, they are enjoyable in a way that a lot of Black Mirror isn't.  On the other hand, part of what make Black Mirror so interesting was the absence of catharsis.  That one could watch an episode of Black Mirror and it has the power to ruin your whole day; yet somehow still be compelling.

Like I get that Robert was torturing the clones but I think he would have never taken it seriously no matter what because it was all just a game to him?

I would have loved for the episode to end like this. So they go through the worm hole and the screen fades into white. The camera slowly pans down on to Nanette's face from the ceiling. She's lying in a chair using the VR software. The run ends and she comes back to the reality, eyes full of life once more. She seems distant, regaining consciousness as to what has just happened. She looks around and meets Robert at the other side of the table. He says, ""Congratulations, you broke my coding skills. You're a truly talented coder and you're capable of handling stressful situations. Welcome to the team, you start Monday."" as if he had set up that whole thing to find the best employees. They both get up to leave the room and Robert is talking to her like the confidence he had as the captain. The camera stays in the room and then it cuts off as the door closes.

It would be a similar twice to Playtest in that the game was all his imagination in the 4 seconds he had to live. She was put in a setting, that's how she dealt with it and she won.

6258,1516062302,7qodqa,False,7,4,"In Hang the DJ, neither character can remember where they were before they ""came here"" (though they can remember the first night they were together, meaning the ""here"" appears to refer to the simulation.) Do you interpret this to mean that neither character has any memories of their ""real world"" sources? If so, don't you think it strange that you can test the compatibility of two people with a lifetime of memories and experiences by throwing them into a simulation where both are stripped of memories and experiences?

Now, we may interpret the above to mean that the characters aren't void of all memories, but rather just have a gap between the memories of their ""real world"" sources and those memories relating to being in the simulation. This would make sense as the ""Real world"" sources would have no memories of entering the simulation as they do not in fact enter the simulation themselves (though they would have memories of signing up perhaps.) If this is the case, however, why do we see no real discussion of family, pre-simulation relationships, occupation goals, hard pre-simulation experiences? 

We might also say that one can maintain a ""Personality"" or state of being apart from conscious memory of experiences, even if we accept that such Personality was developed based, in part at least, by such experiences. We'd say then that the simulations share all the beliefs/characteristics/dispositions of the real world simulations without any conscious memories that fuel such things. Such simulation to me, however, would seem of little use because with no conscious memories to draw from - a cookie's beliefs/characteristics/dispositions would be subject to change drastically based on the current state of the harsh simulation. Think of someone with extreme Alzheimer's - the lack of memory drastically changes the person herself (obviously there's lots of other things going on with Alzheimer's but memory loss is a big part of things.) This is all amplified by the fact that the cookies are undergoing extreme external duress, duress that could mold and shape their relationship in a way that the real world versions may never experience.

I was over at my parents' place for the holidays when season 4 was released. We're not a conservative family or anything but obviously watching something with excessive sex scenes around your family is awkward, so I figured Black Mirror would be a good choice to put on while I was there (because IIRC previous seasons were far from NSFW). I'd watch it around them but not *with* them - just had it playing on my phone or laptop for myself, lounging around in the living room with them while they did their own thing

This means that they weren't around for the full episodes, they'd just hear bits and pieces as they walked around the house or lounged in the living room with me. And from episode 2 onwards, it just so happened that they would be there EVERY TIME there was either a sex scene, or heavy panting

Now, ok, sex scenes are whatever cuz I would just pause and go do something else or just skip the scene, nbd since they're not watching with me. Plus, sex is an accepted (albeit awkward) part of media, so I'm not complaining about sex scenes. But the PANTING, SO MUCH PANTING, literally every time a female character is running (like the two times the mother in Arkangel is looking for her daughter) it's all UH UH UH UH UH and my family is there *listening* with no context... so I turned off episode 2 in annoyance to finish it later on alone

Then episode 3. Again, skip the sex scenes if my family were around so whatever, but also again, THE PANTING - first scene when they're getting rid of the body, both scenes where she kills her friend and the investigator, when she's getting rid of the bodies again... it's all UH UH UH UH UH UH

Episode 4, sex scenes but again WHATEVER, even if they were annoyingly (and unnecessarily?) prolonged. Not a lot of women running but sure enough, when they were, there was heavy panting involved

Now, episode 5 was what infuriated me enough to want to complain about this - before that, it was all just WHATEVER. But when the whole 50 minutes of the episode is literally just a woman running around panting heavily... if I wanted to spend 50 minutes of my life like that I'd watch porn. That shit was annoying even though my family knew the context - they could see it was just a woman running but they weren't *watching the show* (they were playing chess), I was, and they just heard all the panting in the background

Again, just out of sheer annoyance I turn it off and skip to the next episode. And it was going good for a while, until I get to the sex scene - I skip it annoyed af and don't even care enough to skim through right to when it ends, I just skip an arbitrarily long period (I think a minute or so). But it's still panting. Skip again, they're still in bed talking ... while panting, of course, but whatever I'm tired of skipping so I leave it. And then the panting intensifies, so I just shut it off and put on a different show

Like I said, I don't know what compelled me to type out this long rant about something so trivial, and something that I may have just been annoyed by since my family were present. Sure, if I were watching it alone or with friends, or even WITH my family as opposed to them just passively being there doing their own thing but not watching, it's possible I wouldn't be this annoyed (at least they'd get the context). But then episode 5 was really the final straw - when I went to finish watching it in my room later in the day it was still awkward because my brother was in the living room outside, and even when I was completely alone it was fucking annoying as hell - is all that heavy panting really necessary?

It's not just Black Mirror, it's media (TV, movies) in general - there's always loud, annoying panting whenever a woman is running, giving birth, exerting even minimal effort doing something, etc etc. Is anyone else annoyed by this or am I just being crazy, or is it just because I'm a girl? I really don't believe I'm sexually repressed or anything, I don't mind sex scenes or nudity, I've sat through Westworld and a few GoT seasons with my parents. I just think the clearly exaggerated panting is graceless and gratuitous, if not mildly (and now overly) infuriating, especially when you're watching it while other people are hanging around and not watching with you (not just family, ANYONE)

So I just wanted to throw my 2 cents in there to see if anyone else feels the same and in case any TV producers are listening. It. Is. Annoying. We know what you're doing and why you're doing it, it's cheap af and makes shit unwatchable. And while I'm at it I'd like to add that chewing noises are even WORSE. I'm probably the least picky person when it comes to movies and TV - I'll *watch* anything, even if I don't like it, but I've turned off and boycotted my fair share of movies and shows just because some asshole is eating food like a camel or the sound of them chewing gum is louder than the fucking dialogue. The movie Sicario especially comes to mind because I really wanted to watch it but in literally every one of Brolin's scenes his gum chewing is all I could hear, so that was a shame

anyway, /endrant

6380,1515963411,7qekh6,False,11,86,,False,blackmirror,Looks like someone at BuzzFeed read the r/blackmirror easter eggs thread
6381,1515962942,7qeina,False,19,14,"To be honest, I really didn't like most of season 4. I felt like it relied way too heavily on the idea of cookies with no real twists or very original ideas. White Christmas was one of my favorite episodes of the series, but mostly because it was a new and unexplored idea.
Episodes like Nosedive, Be Right Back, The Entire History of You, Shut Up and Dance, and even 15 Million Merits offer interesting technologies and really showcase what I believed to be the point of Black Mirror.

My (very controversial) rankings for S4:

1. Crocodile

2. Arkangel

3. Metalhead

4. Hang the DJ

5. Black Museum

6. USS Callister


USS Callister: This honestly is in my bottom 3 episodes for the entire series. However, I actually really liked the atmosphere and acting in the episode, but there were so many plotholes I simply couldn't get past. I also really disliked the overall tone of the episode (I know not every episode needs to be as dark as something like 15MM, but the humor for me was just a bit off-putting). Also, the idea of being stuck in a video game is so cliched at this point and combine it with basically the same cookie-tech established in S2 (?), it felt like a crappier remake of I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream.

Arkangel: My second favorite episode of the season, Arkangel offered not necessarily a new technology, but a different and interesting take on those found in Entire History of You and White Christmas (filtering). I didn't particularly love the story, but the episode was the most ""Black Mirror-y"" to me. I did however feel like the ending was quite a letdown. The pregnancy was an interesting twist but felt a bit unfinished. I'm not exactly sure what a better one would have been, but it just felt incomplete.

Crocodile: My favorite episode of the season. The technology was pretty similar again to that found in Entire History of You, but less developed and used in an interesting application. The story was engaging, characters likable (well not Mia...), and the twist (although a bit implausible that a guinea pig would be able to accurately recall a person well enough to recognize them without any additional prompting) pleasantly unexpected.

Hang the DJ: The ""spiritual successor to San Junipero"", I thought this episode was pretty average (To be fair, I didn't particularly love SJ either). Although it offered an interesting successor technology to our current ways of dating, I don't think this episode really made a particularly important or interesting statement about the problems of this technology. Also, I found the episode a bit repetitive (I am aware that that's kind of the point) and boring. Also, the twist at the end was over-foreshadowed and I really hate the ""it's all just a simulation!"" cliche. It felt a bit cheap to me.

Metalhead: Although generally hated, I actually liked this episode. I felt like the juxtaposition of B&amp;W with a high-tech wasteland rather interesting and added to the overall bleakness of the episode. It wasn't the most exciting episode and I certainly think it could have been shortened, the episode was a welcome break from the general setting of Black Mirror. Although I think that the twist could have been more effective, I actually rather liked that all that they had gone through was simply for the comfort of a child.

Black Museum: I really liked some aspects of the story, but in general it felt like a worse version of White Christmas.

a. I actually really liked this story. Maybe because it was based on a a short story apparently, but the concept of being addicted to pain felt new and interesting.

b. Although the story was good, I just kept thinking it was a remake of the second story in WC, and the end was just a redesign of the cookie being forced into compliance formula.

c. Maybe it was just because the second story involved cookies, but by the end I was so tired of this formulaic twist (people trapped in computer -&gt; eternal suffering) that I really hated this last story.

Looking up discussions I thought to myself how the clone of Nanette and the cookie woman in White Christmas both wake up and immediately have a panic attack/existential crisis when they wake up, meanwhile in San Junipero, Kelly and Yorkie, along with Carrie from Black Museum are completely fine when they are transferred into the system because they are aware of what is happening. 

This got me thinking. What if the patients who undergo the Cookie process are told a placebo that they would be in the cookie and (most of) what it entails. Would they still have a panic attack? Or would they submit to the tasks they are presented with, and would they be more personable with the real person? Now of course no one would voluntarily opt in on becoming a personal assistant for the rest of possibly eternity, and then wake up completely fine. 

An interesting thing to note is the euthanasia that the patients go through when their consciousness is uploaded. They are completely aware that they are going through the process so if they wake up, imagine the reaction to NOT be in San Junipero or in someone else's brain. Since it's code it doesn't matter how they react. They're just a program. 

Another detail I enjoyed was when they're playing infinity or taking a ""trial run"" to San Junipero they're aware they're in a ""game"" so when they are actually transferred to San Junipero it feels much more real, like Yorkie said when because it's they're consciousness transferred instead of just being linked.

Before I get started, I know that art is interpreted in many ways, but I feel like seeing it this way could benefit the world in that these things won’t happen anymore in real life.
Less about fiction, more about fact. 
I see Black Mirror as an exaggerated representation of fact. 

Let’s take Episode 2 season 1, Fifteen Million Merits, for an example.

1.They’re riding on bikes which is their way of making currency. They find the bikes a chore, but they all show up to do it anyway. Those who don’t perform properly are forced to be treated a second class citizen as a janitor or be on degrading shows. 
This is what people do to make money in real life. How many people work in jobs that feel like a chore just to make the money to sustain their existence? I know of many. I also hear stories of people who are assholes to janitors and waiters just because of their position in society!

2. They’re basically harassed with media and sexual imagery all the time! 
Do I have to get into how that is just like the real world? 

3. They are starved of true connection and spend most of their time working and alone. 
I also know of a lot of people who spend a lot of time either alone or at work. 

4. They have to pay to skip ads. 
We also have to pay to skip ads. Instead of spending money it’s spent time. 

5. They all have to wear uniforms to work. 
Yeah. 

6. The only people who get off the bikes are famous people. The famous people are praised for their unique outfits, and those who wear uniforms dream of living that “free” life. 
Double yeah. 

7. The people get a chance to get on this TV show like “America’s Got Talent” to show their unique talent in hopes of becoming free from the tedious chore of riding a bike all day. 
Working in an office all day sounds worse than riding a bike honestly. Real world, step up your game!

8. They eat unhealthy food for lunch out of a vending machine. 
Triple yeah. 

9. The famous judges get clapped at no matter what they say really. Everyone respects their authority. 
Quadruple yeah. 

10. The only other way out of the bike seems to be to do porn for money. 
Especially easy when you’re an attractive female. Anything to get out of that soul sucking job!!  

11. Porn ends up being just as soul sucking. 
A lot of porn stars are very depressed and can turn to drugs. 

12. Bing speaks the brutal truth. He realizes he is trapped and decides to play by “their” rules in the end. 
Most celebrities begin their artistic careers genuine, then they start to do what will make them money. That’s why they're called “sell outs.”

There it is, I can do this for all other episodes if anyone would like to read them. Also, is there anyone else who sees Black Mirror the way I do?

6424,1515912135,7qae2g,False,9,27,"so the main question in my mind was whether or not daly deserved his death or not. for the sake of this argument, let's just close an eye regarding all the plotholes and focus on the main question instead. here's a long essay and it's my first black mirror review so please bear with all the mistakes. 


ARG 1: I feel really bad that daly died
daly was just doing what all of us do at the end of the day, go home and think of the ideal kind of life we all want, which may include people (who have hurt us) to suffer, emotionally or physically. the only difference was that at time point in time, where that gaming tech had been invented, he was able to one up our current situation by engaging in a very realistic simulation of his members. in a sense, it's like playing VR GTA but when you shoot someone and they bleed, they don't JUST bleed but they also experience the feeling of pain, which is made possible by the additional layer of code. so i'd say it's just further down the road of what we are achieving now, and it isn't entirely unrealistic. i feel that he does not deserve to die simply because he hurt some simulations, which are just CODE. so in sum, it's illogical for us humans (who are comprised of CELLS) to feel emotionally for CODE.


ARG 2: it doesn't matter if he does it to CODE or CELLS, he deserves his death for the torture he inflicted
the argument above states that it is illogical for CELLS to feel for CODE, but as we all know, it is and has always been logical for CELLS to feel for CELLS. so in that case, it should make sense for CODE to feel for CODE, right? (if this doesn't convince you, think of it as, we may all be actually CODE, since both are indistinguishable, just that we know that the origin of CODE is man's intelligence while we are unaware of CELL's origin) so if someone (even if he is made of CODE) is able to feel empathetic/pitiful/sad that someone else (also made of CODE) is hurt, then the ""pain"" felt is real, which means it would be immoral to inflict it, which in turn means daly is a bastard for hurting his simulations. 


for the sake of this topic, let's assume GOD exists (we shall do the inverse in the next para)
so this situation is quite simple: an exact replica of the situation in the episode, just that GOD isn't plugged in or anything, just that he's playing a game and WE are the simulations. i guess most of us would now agree that the pain that we humans feel is real, hence it would only make sense for us not to hurt one another. so when we feel that we've been hurt without a valid reason, we get angry at GOD for making us feel this pain, exactly how the simulations got angry at daly for making them feel their pain. so can it be said that our (we, humans') attempt to disprove religious instructions/beliefs/rules is similar to nanette overriding the system by hacking it? (just that she was successful while we have not been yet) On the other hand, if we agree with ARG 1 that it is alright for CELL to hurt CODE, then isn't it justified that GOD hurts us in all the ways he does?


( IF COUNTER-ARGUMENT for above para is that GOD is not the one who hurts us and that we hurt ourselves, i'd say ""but it is still GOD who gave us the ABILITY to feel pain"" ::in other words, he CELLED us this way:: but if you're gonna argue that GOD didn't give us that ability, then you might as well say GOD doesn't exist, then you defy the basic assumption of this argument)


now let's say GOD does not exist
so we would be considered GOD to these simulations made of CODE (not the same material of what we are made of, but still CODE is legitimate in the sense that it is the building block of the beings we have created). in that case, do we have the right to hurt these simulations however we want to, because they aren't made of CELLS, ( insert reason for justification here ) ? if so, why are we given the right, when at the same time, CODE is unjust to hurt CODE, while CELLS is unjust to hurt CELLS? On the other hand, if do we not have the right to hurt them, then the argument would be somewhat over as we agree with ARG 2, but this brings me to my next question: look at next para


now let's say GOD exists, while we are also considered god to these simulations ( a mixture of the above 2 paras )
so as a continuation of agreeing w stance 2, we then have to agree that it is ... ( i have forgotten my argument fkkk )



NEXT PARA ON AI
as Trisha has mentioned, this CELL vs CODE can greatly impact mankind in the future once AI is fully developed to have the capacity of functioning as well as (or even better than) humans. at that point in time, there will be 2 DIFFERENT lifeforms on this planet: one made of CODE and the other made of CELLS. so if today we say that it is justified for CELLS to hurt CODE, then is it also justified that CODE is allowed to hurt CELL? if yes, then that will pose a major problem to man as CODED-beings will simply deem CELLED-beings as inferior and find ways to eradicate us: we'll all be dead. hence, ARG 1 would prove to be ineffective in the future.


on the other hand, if it is not justified for CELLS today to hurt CODE (in accordance to ARG 2), then it will be a much safer environment in the future where it is universally accepted (inclusive of CODED-beings and CELLED-beings) that it is wrong to hurt either groups of lifeform. hence, once again, ARG 2 would prove to be more effective. 


in sum, i think i have solved it: it is wrong of him to hurt the simulations. contrary to the reddit comment and my initial argument of it not being wrong for someone to imagine/fantasise their ideal life, this isn't just a thought. i'm not sure yet what i would consider this game that he created as, but since it is AI, i would already think of it as a new lifeform as its own, just that it is still in its early stages, hence making it sound ridiculous to think of it as a lifeform on its own. evolution will take place.

Generally they would talk about a subject, and Karl would suggest some absolute nonsense, and Ricky Gervais and Steve Merchant would have a good laugh at him.

Now, I can't remember the exact episodes, but one time, Karl suggested the idea for doctors to have a chip in their head that could let them feel what the patient was feeling. So that if a patient didn't know how to describe what was wrong, or couldn't communicate, the doctor could diagnose them by physically feeling their pain. As that story progressed in Black Museum I was like ""Huh, this is just like that thing Karl Pilkington said once. What a weird coincidence.""

Now then, on a different occasion, Karl came up with an idea for a film. In which a person gets hit by a truck and goes into a coma, and a doctor suggests to the person's distraught partner that they can transfer the comatose persons conscious into their brain, so that they can both live in the same body.

Imagine my surprise then, when in the next portion of Black Museum, that exact thing happens. Now I've paused the episode at the point where the guy brings up putting the comatose woman's mind into another brain. Both to make this post and because I was laughing so much. So I will make a prediction. In Karl Pilkington's movie, a woman gets her husband's mind put in her head. They can talk to each other mentally, but eventually the woman realises her husband was having an affair because his mind keeps thinking about another woman. The husband's mind starts to take over the wife's body a bit too, and the wife ends up in a relationship with her husband's mistress.

I'm hoping to god that's what happens in Black Museum. And then the third story could be about a monkey robbing a bank or something.",True,blackmirror,I'm halfway through Black Museum. Did Karl Pilkington write this episode or what? (Spoilers)

I could go on about what this material is, but I've been really stuck on a tiny bit of dialogue that takes place while Stripe and Raiman are training the day after Stripe killed two roaches at Heidekker's house. Raiman at one point states something to the degree of ""If they made it to the forest, *they probably made it to the border*"", suggesting that this war is limited to a very specific region which may or may not still bear resemblance to our contemporary understanding of a nation-state. So there's a lot of implications to this statement: are roaches political refugees elsewhere? How vast is this war? Is it confined to the (seemingly) Scandinavian region? The fact that there is a border at all, and moreover a border that can and is crossed with some frequency by roaches that American soldiers are aware of but themselves *cannot cross* has a lot of implications for the specificities of the Men Against Fire universe. 

It's a very tiny and seemingly insignificant detail, but it's prompted a lot of speculation and thinking on my end, specifically regarding how such a border could impact the relationship between Men Against Fire and Hated in the Nation (which we know happen at the same time in the same universe), and then later what that could mean for the very existence and purpose of the dogs in Metalhead. 

EDIT: so this line of questioning led me to fully flesh out the geopolitics and economy of the universe on a timeline that I think reslly might hold some water - if anyone wants to discuss further I'm reslly fucking excited about it!

**Determination of expiry date:**

Mostly through things like common interests and questions about turn offs and personality traits. Simple example - app asks whether your house is always clean or messy or dirty. You reply messy. You find a profile which has answered clean to this question. So the app would guess something like ""Expiry in 2 days because your partner will come to your house to netflix and chill and be turned off because of a messy place"". 

Also when you un-match with a person you actually went on a date with, you get to answer a few things which help the app understand what turned you off about the partner. So for your later matches, it keeps those questions in account.

Just a simple example. Of course there needs to be a disclaimer that these are just predictions and point of the app is for you to find someone compatible and hence prove the app wrong.

NOT TOO BAD

#19 Hang the DJ - Nicola wasn’t scary enough to keep this episode away from the last spot. 

#18 Nosedive - I feel for Chester. But really nothing too bad here compared to others.

#17 The Waldo Moment - The only reason I don’t think Trump is even worse than Waldo and this episode is because I’m white.

#16 San Junipero - All in all, pretty positive. I personally think a thing people miss is that Kelly is choosing Yorkie, who she never even knew in the world, over a chance to be with her husband and daughter from the real world. I found that to be pretty fucked up and the reason I don’t put it last on the list, despite the common belief that this is a rare “happy ending” episode. But screw heaven, right?

#15 Metalhead - If this were strictly about death count, it would be number one. Yet, it was much too vague and impersonal to affect me much at all. I really didn’t care that the girl was going to die and I found it very predictable that there would be more robot dogs after that first one.

IT COULD’VE BEEN WORSE

#14 Be Right Back - I mean, she fucks a damn robot. Not sure things would be much better for her without the technology, though. She may have moved on a bit faster, but she also may have been depressed for much longer. It is tough to say. And hey, one less child who doesn’t know her father!

#13 Fifteen Million Merits - Despite this totally fucked up world, most of the characters don’t really seem to know any better and that never really changes in the end. The concept is very fucked up, but I never really felt bad for the characters at all (a lot like how Metalhead isn’t lower).

#12 Arkangel - Maybe it would be higher if I was a mother and could relate more to the horror of seeing your child try cocaine and fuck a white boy unprotected. Bonus points for when Sara repeatedly punches her mom in the face. Shit was crazy. Negative points for when she gets up and walks around without a problem.

#11 U.S.S. Callister - They weren’t real people, but the fact that those in the crew were technically conscious makes it sort of fucked up. The concept that video game characters were able to kill a person got me thinking. Robert seemed to deserve to die, anyways. 

PRETTY FUCKED UP

#10 The Entire History of You - Yes, Liam has to watch his wife cheat on him on a television screen. Although, some people have it worse in real life and literally walk in on them. The child not being his hurts, but again, it happens in real life as well. I’ll give it some value because it did make me feel pretty uncomfortable as we saw Liam become addicted to replaying footage.

#9 Crocodile - This would have been much lower if it felt more realistic and had better character development. I just can’t buy that Mia would realistically go to these extremes. How in the hell would a tiny female be able to kill a bigger, stronger grown man completely unarmed? It’s problems sort of took me out of the moment too much to make me feel that fucked up. That scene with the baby, though. Gave me goosebumps.

#8 Playtest - More of a mindfuck than straight fucked up (and yes, I think there is a difference). The ending, though, extremely fucked. How the game mixed in with his real life family problems. SHIT!

HOLY SHIT THIS IS INSANE

#7 Hated in the Nation - The twist where the bees turn on the “killers” does it all. Easily the most underrated episode in Black Mirror.

#6 Black Museum - All three stories intrigue me immensely. The first story is amazing, one I would love to see as its own episode. It is extremely surreal and messed up. All three make me feel disgusted when I think that I could be in those situations. Not a huge fan of the twist, though, or else this could compete for top 3 (partly because it didn’t include my favorite story of the three). 

#5 Men Against Fire - A little biased because this is the first episode I ever watched and is my all time favorite. But holy shit, was this a roller coaster ride. Horribly fucked up making him relive his kill with the device turned off. Most people forget that this is a genocide against those believed to be genetically inferior. It is a much closer analogy to Hitler’s soldiers killing Jews than US soldiers killing ISIS. These “roaches” are completely innocent.

WHO THE FUCK WOULD WRITE THIS

#4 White Bear - Could be number one or two, I just acknowledge the fact that Victoria isn’t exactly innocent by any means. Still, the things they put her through are absolutely horrendous. The twist is spectacular, and it makes me sad that I rooted for her for the majority of the episode. Seeing the torture that she is put through and how it only repeats over and over, I can’t help but still feel sick for her.

#3 The National Anthem - Easily the most uncomfortable moment in Black Mirror. I very much believe that there are some things that are worse to watch than death. A grown man fucking a pig is definitely one of those things. The reality that every single person goes to their TV’s to watch, is also pretty damn horrendous.

#2 Shut Up and Dance - The best twist in all of Black Mirror. Incredibly uncomfortable. His bank robbery made me want to throw up just considering being in that situation myself. The fact that I rooted for a kid the entire episode that I later find out is a pedophile, it was like White Bear on steroids. Completely heart-wrenching and sickening. 

#1 White Christmas - This episode definitely has a little bit of everything. People underestimate how fucked it is being stuck in a white, meaningless room for six months. That is a million times worse than death, as it would drive you absolutely insane with nothing to stop or limit that insanity. The first story is incredibly uncomfortable and fucked up to watch. The story Joe has where he is erased from Beth’s life made me feel disgusting and horrendous. And to see the entire meaning of what is going on come to fruition, it only got even more fucked up than I ever expected.

6574,1515788357,7pzdm0,False,12,45,"I really like 15MM, but when I watched it for the first time, the idea of all power being generated by humans pedaling on bikes seemed to be a little far-fetched, as well as in violation of thermodynamics (especially with all of those screens). So, I thought of it as merely an allegory for our own capitalist, consumerist society which wouldn't necessarily have to be realistic.

More recently, though, I had another thought: what if the bikes were only there keep people occupied? I ran with that idea for a while and here's my theory: 15MM takes place in a society where automation has rendered most jobs obsolete. To cope with mass unemployment, a perverse form of Universal Basic Income (UBI) is implemented. Everyone is provided with food, shelter, entertainment, and ""work"". This keeps their society stable and might even be considered benevolent by some. In fact, the primary form of employment, cycling, might be intended to just keep people reasonably healthy. 

Of course, not everyone in this society is a cyclist. The ""fat people"" clean up trash and serve the riders, but while their work may be ""lower"", I don't imagine that their ""home lives"" are actually much different than those of the riders. Perhaps the engineers of this society believe that there needs to be some sort of hierarchy in order to motivate people: a lower social class to avoid falling into and a higher social class to strive for. This brings us to the judges of the talent show. It seems that one of the only thing that humans are actually useful for in this world is entertainment; that is why all of the ""elites"" that we see in this society are in the entertainment industry. They search for people to entertain others, be it through singing or through porn, and offer them a ""better"" life. This motivates the masses and gives them some sort of hope in order to keep them compliant.

This theory fits with the overarching themes of Black Mirror. The people who created this society may have had good intentions: keeping society stable and providing humans with their basic needs, but it has been corrupted and has turned into a dystopia where people do meaningless work, enjoy meaningless entertainment, and ultimately live meaningless lives.

TL;DR: The society of 15MM is engineered to keep people busy and compliant. The bikes are a lie. Panem et circenses.

**TIN FOIL HAT TIME!**
[Spoiler Alert](/s ""After watching the season 4 episode, ""Black Museum,"" I thought of another possible layer to my theory above. In ""Black Museum"", we see a character reading a graphic novel version of 15MM. This could be just a clever reference, but it could also be an indication that the world of 15MM has some sort of tie to the world of ""Black Museum."" When talking about the monkey, Rolo says that the UN determined that cookies have limited rights, one of which is that they cannot be deleted. Perhaps as a kinder alternative to spending eternity inside stuffed animals, certain cookies have been put inside virtual environments, similar to the ones seen in San Junipero. These environments are much simpler than San Junipero simulations whether due it being an earlier version of the virtual reality technology or an unwillingness to afford cookies the same privileges as the consciousnesses of dead humans. Perhaps 15MM takes place in a virtual society meant to keep cookies sane and safe from deletion."")",False,blackmirror,Theory about 15 Million Merits' society

The number 99.8% is used in 2 kinda unrelated locations in the episode:

1. Inside the simulation itself Eva and Frank are told that the success of the partner finding program is 99.8 % I’m finding ur ideal partner.

2. At the very end real life’s Frank and Eva have a compatibility of 99.8% based on 998 rebellions.


This is very confusing because does it mean that when your compatibility with someone is 70% because of 700 rebellions all the people in the simulation would be told that the partner finding program has the success rate of 70%

6607,1515767356,7pwwij,False,76,116,"the BM subreddit is one of the few places I haven't seen completely bashing Metalhead, which is my favourite episode of S4. This is not exactly going to be a defence of the episode, because if you hated it you'll probably also hate this theory. I'm not trying to say anyone is wrong for disliking it, either, because that's what I really dig about BM, that we can all watch it and think and like different things so it's almost impossible to form a consensus on the best episode. 

Now I've got that out of the way, a theory. I don't subscribe to the idea that it takes place in the White Bear Amusement Park or some Northern version of it. I know that was a white bear at the end btw, but that mostly reminded me of the original meaning of the ""white bear"": that it was a symbol of the search for the girl that Ian and Victoria murdered (in White Bear), as a toy that she dropped when they kidnapped her. 

I'm really glad that Charlie Brooker cut the scene of the dogs being controlled by humans too, mostly because I think it echoes Men Against Fire and White Bear too much. Discounting that, I interpreted this episode as a parable for how humans have gradually have (willingly) given control over to technology, until they eventually lost control of the world. 

I know this is super basic for BM, but I thought of it because of the (little) technology we see in Metalhead: driverless cars, the security system of the couple's apartment, and obviously the dogs. I think the impetus of this is how humans trust machines more and more to run their life, but forget how machines are basically different from us (I mean obviously). We have basically taught machines how to control us.

 So, at the end of the world, the dogs flip out, though I don't have any theory on if tis originates from the dogs (which I prefer) or from an illness, as Bella implies her sister died of an illness and obviously her nephew is sick. Ultimately, this means that  even someone like Bella - and obviously the men she was with, who were noted for being extremely self-sufficient - are powerless to stop the machines. In how Bella can't contact the safe haven where she lives at the end when she dies and she's even betrayed by the car radio, the sensors and scanners of machines overpower the very sincere human relationships which are still present in this episode (like the black dude sacrificing himself to save Bella, and Bella telling the walkie-talkie that she's ""always loved you all"" even though she isn't sure if they can hear her).",True,blackmirror,Metalhead theory + why it doesn't deserve the hate.

He claimed the tech in this episode was merely a springboard to advance the story of a crime drama and could have easily been replaced with any other storydevice whereas I had the complete opposite take away. 

I though the episodes main point was to show the potential dangers that comes with intruding a persons mind and memories.

Cave-raiders adventure down seeking fame and fortune, but the most dangerous challenge is returning back to the surface. Accompanied by a BRILLIANT soundtrack, World-building as dense as another planet, twists that manifest in the story of survival of purposeful characters, some of the most beautiful environmental Artwork,  touches on the subjects like the cycle of life, the cruelty of survival of the fittest, religion, and the effect of technology &amp; power in the wrong hands.

I would recommend the 1.0 movies as a start, then the original anime series from 1995 &amp; OVA, as another perspective. It may be convoluted, but it has well written characters, gripping plots, intensely gripping action scenes, &amp; uncomfortable truths . It is a true classic in it's genre.

Based on USS Callister and some earlier episodes, are we to believe that in the Black Mirror universe, we ought to sympathise with these cookies or simulations when they are in need of ""help""? 

Whilst watching USS Callister, real life Nanette was going about her normal, regular day whilst her simulation was being taken advantage off... Are we  actually supposed to feel sorry for the simulation when her human self was quite fine and didn't even know the simulated self existed?

If real life Nanette didn't respond to the call, then what harm would have been caused to Daly's co-workers in real life? It's seems like none... To me, Daly was just playing his own version of The Sims.

If I had an IMVU account (like a real time Sims) and I made an Avatar, lived a different life, met people and used it for a couple months only to leave it on ""auto mode"" and forget about it (assuming it's resources will eventually run out) Won't it be _similar_ to the above? Simulated Avatar is just existing aimlessly yet trapped whilst real life me is going about life as normal... I would eventually forget about my Avatar and not even care... In other words, the destruction of Nanette's simulation didn't affect her in real life...

The dog does a perfect assasination on two people but doesn't kill the main character when it has the perfect chance in the car? The main character finds an untouched very expensive car in front of an untouched very expensive home, which also luckily has the keys on a very accessible place, a shotgun, running water and random paint THAT HASN'T WENT STIFF lying around? AND RUNNING ELECTRICITY? Isn't this supposed to be an apocalypse? Who the fuck is keeping up the electricity to the housing? Are the dogs bill collectors? She luckily finds the keys to the car outside only for scary movie plot twist #91 - car doesn't start to occur? And albeit she's seen these dogs before and knows exactly where to shoot it and what to do, along with the fact it has a battery that runs out, she has no idea it's going to spray lethal shit when it dies?  

And they did all of that for a fucking teddy bear? For an ill child? You'd think if they can find random vans and cars lying around it wouldn't be that much of a fucking hastle to hit a Toys'R'Us up since if the idiots in whatever this apocalypse is didn't think about  searching through a warehouse (it looked untouched when they entered) they probably didn't go through a Toys'R'Us either.  

I fucking loved this show. I showed my girlfriend San Junipero because it's one of my favourite episodes of any TV show. That episode had soul. It not only HAD a story, it BUILT a story.

6696,1515696862,7pqbl3,False,32,28,"Basically, I’ve come to the conclusion that American audiences will enjoy Black Mirror slightly more than British Audiences due to the simple issue of Actor/Actress casting.

I mean, Black Mirror is hands down one of the best series’ that I’ve watched however, the actresses and actors in the British parts are hard to relate to due to being overused in BBC Drama’s and other soaps.

This causes Typecasting and can be irritating when you’ve managed to watch a whole season of that specific actor/actress being a main character and then you’re forced to watch them again in a different role which kind of doesn’t mesh, I mean this isn’t a big deal however, I feel as though it does have an effect especially when you’re laid there thinking ‘what else have I seen them in?!’ For half the episode. It just takes a slight refreshing edge away from it.

I’m not saying I’m correct and I’m not saying you’re all going to agree with my opinion but I just feel that as an American you’re coming into British drama territory with a blank slate whereas we’re all seeing the same overused actors/actresses all over again and being forced to forget their roles in other huge British series’

I just wondered what you guys think and whether any of you could relate because it really irritates me and I find episodes such as ‘Nosedive’ brilliant due to the fact they’re American’s who I haven’t seen in any other piece of television but maybe those episodes are the same for American’s who have seen those actors and actresses before?

Wraith Babes and Hot Shots appear in other episodes, but the situation in those episodes seems very different, and we also know that there's a graphic novel based on it.  This is confusing because it seems factual according to The Waldo Moment and White Christmas, but fictional according to Black Museum.  However, I think this can be resolved.

Initially, there is fat-shaming and prejudice against genetically ""inferior"" individuals.  People with a genetic propensity to obesity are expected, and later mandated, to exercise constantly.   They can be identified at birth via genetic screening.  This mandatory exercise leads to them being incarcerated in concentration camps, such as we see in Fifteen Million Merits, but the rest of society is either in denial about it or it's not an official policy, so it's like the Holocaust.

Later on, a ""final solution"" is developed whereby genocide is perpetrated on the people concerned.  This is an extension of the fat-shaming.  Britain had the concentration camp solution, but other countries did different things.  Hence Men Under Fire is the genocide and ethnic cleansing.

There's a real comic book called MAUS which is about the Holocaust:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maus .  This is similar to the comic book we see in Black Museum.

Just my opinion.

6701,1515694205,7pq00a,False,12,0,"Within this episode, the real world has a simulation that tells you if the person is a match 99.6% of the time. However, that simulation is using 1,000 simulations wherein a copy of yourself is told by a program that a certain someone is a 99.6% perfect match, and in the show they reject that program's suggestion to go with someone else. So it seems like it's saying that the real life person is a 99.6% perfect match because the simulation of you rejected the simulation's 99.6% match. 

So basically if I see that in real life a girl is a 99.6% match for me, that means that the simulated version of me chose someone who was NOT a 99.6% match 996 out of 1000 times. Wouldn't that therefore mean that I would be better off choosing someone in real life who was NOT the 99.6% match?",False,blackmirror,Isn't this episode sort of a paradox?
6702,1515693843,7ppybz,False,16,23,"I see a lot of people praising this season, but I also see a lot of people dogging on this season. I wanted to make a case for those of us who weren't too crazy about this season.

I want to preface this post by saying I'm simply trying to form a discussion. If you enjoyed this season, that's great! I'm happy you did! I don't think my opinion is superior to anyone elses, but I felt it was necessary to express my opinions on the season. I also feel it's necessary to say that Season 4 was GOOD TELEVISION. It wasn't even the worst season of Black Mirror (although it is pretty close in my opinion). However, I think that this show has set a standard for itself that it really needs to work hard at maintaining, and I don't think this season did a good job of that at all.

My main issue with this season would have to be that half of the episodes felt like copy and paste's of previous episodes where the content of the episode was different but the overall format was exactly the same. For example, ArkAngel felt like an extension to The Entire History of You, Hang the DJ's tone and theme was very similar to San Junipero, and Black Museum was an almost exact carbon copy of White Christmas. 

So that leaves U.S.S Callister, Crocodile, and Metalhead as being the only episodes that don't feel like carbon copies of previous episodes. When I first watched U.S.S Callister, it was a solid episode. I enjoyed it. However, when I rewatched it, it *really* soured my opinion on the episode. Most Black Mirror episodes I have watched have held up a rewatch pretty well with some exceptions (e.g The Entire History of You, Men Against Fire, etc.) U.S.S Callister however did not. The episode is pretty good on a first watch because it relies entirely on tense moments. People call Metalhead the tense episode of the season, but I'd make a case for U.S.S Callister. Once you know what happens in this episode, the tense moments just don't hit you anymore. On a rewatch, U.S.S Callister just feels very flat and just feels almost unnecessary.

Then there is Crocodile. This is of course my own opinion. I wasn't a huge fan of this episode. I think the pacing was very slow and felt almost unbalanced at times. I will say though, the ending of the episode was pretty spectacular, but it just doesn't make up for a poor first 2/3 of the episode. Then lastly we have Metalhead. Everyone has their opinions on Metalhead. My opinion is that it just felt lazy. We're thrown into this scenario that we're supposed to care about this woman who we know nothing about being thrown into this situation we know nothing about getting this item from a warehouse that we know nothing about. As a human being, I empathize with her, but I'm not invested enough in the story to care. Once the twist rolled around with the teddy bears, it just felt so underwhelming.

On top of all the reasons I mentioned above, I think another HUGE issue with this season is that it relied too heavily on neurological/memory technology AND bootleg cookie technology. Every episode, with the exception of Metalhead, relied on one (or both) of these forms of technology. U.S.S Callister relied on cookie technology with the people in the ship, ArkAngel relies on neurological technology with the mind tracker, Crocodile relies on neurological/memory technology with that memory machine, Hang the DJ relies on cookie technology in the simulations, and Black Museum relies on both cookie technology and neurological technology with the pain helmet and the people's consciousness being able to be transferred into other people/objects.

Also, another very small thing that bothered me with Season 4 was that it's starting to feel VERY CAMPY. It feels like almost every episode now has nods to previous episodes, and while they're fun, it gets old very quickly. This is what happened when American Horror Story made its decline, so I really hope that Brooker stops trying to tie all the episodes together because I ultimately think that it's holding the series down a bit.

I think overall, everything just feels recycled and because of that, none of these episodes feel fresh. It felt like a very safe season where no risks were made, with the exception of Metalhead (Which by the way, even though I'm not a fan of Metalhead, I appreciate it for what it was and I hope that Brooker continues to make risks like this one. This one was a miss, but it doesn't mean that every risk he takes will be a miss). Overall, I think everyone who's disappointed with this season enjoys it, we just expect it to be at the standard that Black Mirror has set for itself and I think this season did a poor job of doing so.

TL;DR: This season relied on cookies and neurological technology A LOT, it felt more campy than previous seasons, and half of the episodes felt like they were recycled from previous episodes in the series making Season 4 ultimately feel like it didn't make any risks and felt almost stale.",False,blackmirror,Making a case for those of us who didn't love Season 4

A good example of this is the ending for Uss Callister, which is predominantly accepted as a happy and justified ending, however I feel the message of the episode is lost in its presentation. Sure, the characters escape Daly's game, but none of the real counterparts, who have bullied him (or taken control of his company in Walton's case), have learned anything. Daly clearly had some psychological problems which he needed help for, and I would argue the real upsetting part of the episode is not how awfully he used technology, but rather how the advancements enabled him to escape and not face the problems reality holds.

6747,1515650170,7pm2po,False,77,82,"I find this theory to be one of the most obnoxious in the community. It makes absolutely no sense yet people seem to be obsessed with it. 
Here's why I hate it:

* 1: It's illogical. Many technologies in Black Mirror fundamentally alter the society they are in. In Nosedive, everything is operated by the rating tech. In Entire History of You, being ""grainless"" is a hipster trend, so most everyone presumably has it. These technologies share so much overlap yet so much individual influence that the idea they all came to dominate and then vanish in 100-200 years makes no sense. None of this is to mention that the world, architecture, and automobile tech in many of the episodes are radically different. 

* 2: It doesn't explain the weirdness of Easter Eggs. Ok, so everything is set in the same universe because Men Against Fire appears in Arkangel. How? How do you rationalize footage from one episode appearing in another? Is the world of Arkangel secretly the one where a eugenics empire is ravaging Europe, and hidden cameras float all about? Were the events of Fifteen Million Merits secretly a simulation from which graphic novels were derived and sold? Perhaps these are just easter eggs, unsubtle references to other episodes that are admittedly overused?

* 3: It goes too far and the timelines make zero sense. It's quite easy for me to believe that White Christmas, Callister, Black Museum, White Bear, Hang the DJ, etc. belong in the same universe, quite obviously. But Waldo Moment and Metalhead, along with Fifteen Million Merits? One timeline places Nosedive before Shut Up and Dance. So the entire United States converts to an idyllic, pastel color palette, high tech smart cars, and uniform, super smartphones that transform society, then a few years later Kenny in England robs a bank on his 2014 android phone and escapes in that dumpy car? Then the entire United States deconverts from the Nosedive system in time for the Infinity game in USS Callister where society is clearly 100% different?

Sorry if this is a wall of text, but it needs to be said. I totally buy that some episodes are part of some shared cookie-verse, but some of them paint such unique, society-altering portraits and unique visions of the apocalypse that these timeline theories drive me nuts.

Black Museum is the final bookend to the entire series.  I haven't researched it, but it looks like it references every (or almost every) episode so far.  In the museum, we have displays of the grotesque stories that we have enjoyed just like Rolo and the visitors he has had throughout the years.  When we watch an episode of Black Mirror we are visiting this museum and looking back at the horrors of technology from the past.  This episode has been placed beyond every other episode, in the distant future.  

Nish comes in, destroys these horrors and frees some of those who are trapped in their own hell.  She ends the spectacle of Black Mirror and lays to rest sins and punishments.  

Black Mirror = Black Museum. 

A couple of other notes:

-What does Rolo symbolize?  Brooker? Ourselves for being captivated by these terrible things?  I have a hard time believing that he is essentially the cause of so many bad things that have happened over the course of the series.  Rolo is probably a liar and put himself at the center of most of the stories, and most of them being untrue/half truths. 

-The 15MM graphic novel that appears in the episode.  It's obvious that 15MM has the American Idol show and Bing gets his own show at the end.  I believe these shows are played in this universe and Bing's own story has become adapted to a graphic novel.

6826,1515600807,7pgkw9,False,38,44,"Black Mirror has been my favourite show since 2011 not only because of its imaginative premises but because the show’s best episodes are firmly rooted in reality (‘The National Anthem’, ‘The Entire History of You’, ‘Be Right Back’, ‘White Bear’, ‘Shut Up and Dance’). They’re timeless stories which make you think about challenging ethical issues. 

After watching Black Mirror’s fourth season, I walked away largely unimpressed…

At first, I thought it was because I’m a diehard purist, and maybe I’m just being snooty as more of the world becomes aware of the show and enjoys it for what it is – an hour’s entertainment that you can’t really find anywhere else. However, the more I think about this latest batch of episodes (of which ‘Hang the DJ’ is my personal highlight, with ‘Black Museum’ being a close second), I’ve noticed a recurring criticism which has me worried about the series’ future.

By abiding by genre conventions to quickly generate story ideas, Black Mirror’s smart concepts aren’t being sufficiently explored in recent episodes. Whether it’s Robert Daly being left in a comatose state over a ten-day holiday inside his apartment, the mother in ‘Arkangel’ being beaten half to death by her daughter, Mia being apprehended by the police, or Rolo Haynes experiencing punitive justice… Black Mirror was more concerned with wrapping up this year’s episodes with cheap cathartic flourishes than it was fully exploring the consequences of humans interacting with (and abusing) technology. 

The reason why this must be, as I understand it, is that the creators simply don’t have enough time to let ideas gestate anymore. 

In ‘USS Callister’, the major consequence of digital Nanette liberating herself and the rest of the crew from Daly’s control was that Daly would have known that his AIs had contacted the outside world and arranged for someone to break into his apartment. Real-world Nanette had already asked Daly about him sending her an invite to *Infinity*, so the conventional Black Mirror ending for ‘USS Callister’ – as I saw it – would have seen Daly punish real-world Nanette for stealing from him. In effect, the immortal, digital Nannette would have screwed over her unwitting human counterpart to secure her own freedom. But instead, they had it that the villain was defeated. This suited the sci-fi epic genre the episode was emulating, but it also brushed off the serious consequences of digital beings acting on their own self-interest.

‘Arkangel’ features a truly invasive technology, but by trying to be a mother-daughter indie movie, the technology wasn’t even required for the story to play out. The mother may as well have followed her daughter around as the standard helicopter parent and we’d have gotten the same ending. With such an alluring piece of technology, I thought we were going to see a class full of students being given the answers by their parents at home. An entire generation of pampered children would be raised with no real feelings or thoughts of their own. If a parent doesn’t like a certain child, they block them from their child’s view. The child grows up so dependent upon the technology, they’re reliant on their parents for everything – even when doing their jobs (jobs which their parents have already approved, of course). 

What we ended up getting was a very predictable tale where the protagonist is the only child in her entire school with the technology. Rather than running away from her mother, wouldn’t it have been more chilling for the duo to somehow reconcile? Flashforward ten years when the daughter has a child of her own. The mum asks how her daughter’s getting on with her husband, people at work, and raising her child, as if she doesn’t know the answers. But then, when left alone at evening’s end, we see the mother using her tablet to spy on her daughter (and, now, her grandchild). The mother’s fostered a fake persona around her daughter where she’s oblivious about events in her life just so she doesn’t give the game away that she’s monitoring every facet of her existence without her consent. Surely that was more… Black Mirror-y? I don’t know. Maybe I’m just a frustrated wannabe Black Mirror writer. (Yes, I am.)

I’ll stop my rant with ‘Crocodile’. This episode has one of the most genius and challenging technologies in the entire series. Not only can the authorities picture what you saw… but they can give you information which causes you to remember events differently (it was snowing, she wore a yellow coat, etc). This is a technology which deals with THOUGHT CRIME, not physical crime. Surely, rather than the police relying on this technology to gain access to the truth (which prompts Mia to go on a boring murder frenzy), it would involve the authorities deliberately bending the truth through misleading questions. They get individuals to picture what the authorities want / need to see, not necessarily what happened. But the episode doesn’t explore any of this. Once again, the technology is the least interesting part of the episode… until it’s used by a fucking guinea pig. This was a grim episode just because they decided to write a noir thriller, not because the characters or technology warranted it. 


Having thought about how many episodes this year played it safe with their smart ideas, I’m worried about what season five has in store for us. Brooker cancelled 2017 Wipe because he’s already behind on future scripts. Combined with him editing three volumes of Black Mirror stories which are soon to be published, are Netflix working him too hard to get episodes out on an annual basis? 

Either there’s going to be an additional year’s break between season four and five, or Brooker’s going to be sat naked in his office, scrawling episode ideas on the walls with hands caked in a stranger’s shit – all while Netflix executives maddeningly berate him over the phone and via Skype to save their business now that they’ve decided to end House of Cards.

Charlie Brooker is clearly a science fiction fan, and a lot of these ideas have been explored in prose, especially in the sci-fi short story genre. 

So if you're looking for a Black Mirror-esque story you should check out ""The Cookie Monster"" by Vernor Vinge, written way back in 2003 for an excellent exploration of the cookie idea, which predates Black Mirror considerably. It's definitely available online if you do some googling. Imo the story is so Black Mirror that it could easily be adapted into an episode with only minor changes and updates.

My theory is that this show is not about how dangerous technology is, but how dangerous people are. It’s a show about the complexity of humanity and our morals as people. It’s about how quick we are to judge people without knowing their circumstances. It’s about empathy. There are many, if not all, episodes that have this clear theme. (White Bear and Shut Up and Dance being more obvious examples.) I think this is part of the reason why the episodes containing our current technology are so popular. We focus not on the horrors of the technology, because we already have it, but we instead take a step back and take a moment to think about our own morals. 

An example of this is (spoiler) Shut up and Dance. We are meant to empathize with this kid, because we know this could happen to any of us today, just to find out this seemingly innocent teenager was viewing children. It’s a popular episode because it gets us thinking about our own morals and whether or not we should still feel bad for him, and what we would do in his situation. 

Often times, when we watch more futuristic episodes, we watch for entertainment and think to ourselves “wow, that’s terrifying, good thing that isn’t happening now” or “we’re so far away from that” and you’ll move on. With episodes like SUAD and The National Anthem, you really get to thinking about what you would do in that situation, because it’s not far from reality and things like that have already happened.

6906,1515545087,7pbss9,False,13,26,"My issue with USS Callister is that we never really get Daley's perspective on the whole thing. I was unsure of his motivations the whole time. Obviously he's unhappy with his work situation and uses the Space Fleet mod to revel in his ideal working environment, as well as wantonly exercise power over people he dislikes. But Daley himself never addressed the personhood of the characters in the game, and that would have brought everything together for me.

He clearly knows that the characters think they are real, and have the same memories and personalities as their real world counterparts. But he still treats them like shit. How does he justify his actions? Is it okay to him because in the end it's just a game, and no matter how advanced an artificial intelligence is it's still artificial so it doesn't matter. Or is it real to him? Is he a true sadist that would enjoy torturing real people, but the game is just a way to do it without risk? Basically, if he didn't have that technology, would he just be a loner at work or would he be a serial killer.

Without that being clearly established the story felt a bit unfocused, and he just ended up being a campy villain.

As for Archangel, it fundamentally failed as a Black Mirror episode because in the world of the episode, everyone realises the technology in question is horribly invasive and scary and they stamp it out before it becomes widespread. The first half of the episode was good. But I thought, during the scene with the therapist, that she was going to get misdiagnosed with autism or something and the episode would dive into some crazy territory. However the therapist bluntly says ""Well that chip in her head was a bad idea. Everyone in the world knows it's a bad idea. Turn it off, destroy the screen, problem solved.""

After that there's no need for the episode to continue. All we get is a violent affirmation of that statement. Which also didn't sit well with me. The violence of the ending felt out of place and unbelievable. That would fit as the ending to an episode where she had been living with the filter her whole life, and didn't understand violence or aggression or physical injury. But as it is, in that moment I instantly lost all sympathy for her.

I feel like Black Mirror episodes loosely fall into two categories. Either it's a mostly normal world where someone is abusing technology to hurt others (National Anthem, Hated in the Nation, Shut Up and Dance, etc), or a crazy alternate world where someone cracks under the pressure of ever present and overbearing technology (15 Million Merits, Nosedive, The Entire History of You, etc).

Why did they make Yorkie such a wet blanket? Her personality was basically non-existent, and I can't think of any reason why someone as cool, outgoing, and headstrong as Kelly would fall in love with her. 

Usually the loveable loser is the one that has to pursue the character that's out of their league, but they flipped the script here. Kelly is the one who came on to Yorkie first, and from there Yorkie proceeded to: ignore her advances, show up randomly at the club just to sit across from her and stare, then after they hooked up she followed Kelly around and tried to make her feel bad for breaking off contact, them after they made up she insulted the memory of her dead husband and really pissed Kelly off. And at no point during any of that did she do anything to make us like her, she just gave her sad back story that's supposed to make us pity her (and it worked, I definitely pitied this character), but pity ≠ love. All the reviews I read of this episode talked about how great the chemistry was between the pair, but I didn't see any sparks flying. There was a whole lot of arguing, a little bit of stalking, but no sparks. 

So why did Kelly fall for her? I'm trying hard to come up with reasons and I'm pulling a blank. I know some of you will respond with some cliched shit like ""love is blind"", or ""you can't explain why you love someone"", and I'm not buying it. When George Costanza dated attractive women on Seinfeld, even though he was an unattractive man with an even more unattractive personality I didn't take issue with it. Because Seinfeld was a comedy, it's not about romance, so I suspend my disbelief and just roll with the laughs. But Black Mirror isn't a comedy, so I'm wondering why an hour long episode about a love story made their main character about as desirable as George Costanza.

6935,1515525848,7p9iae,False,38,3,"White Christmas is a comentary on male parental rights.  

For me personally i feel like this episode showcases exactly what good men who have had children with horrible women have to deal with right now in todays world.

Unfortunately when it comes to parental rights men have almost none.  The boyfriend finds out his girlfriend is pregnant and gets upset when he finds out she didnt want to keep HIS child - yes it is his child too; however, the boyfriend has no power in this scenario.  She is entitled to making the decision of keeping or aborting the child 100% on her own - just as it is in the real world.

The girlfriend does decide to keep the child, but blocks the father completely out of her and its life.  This is a parallel to how a woman can steal a baby from its father through the legal system we currently have in place today.

The fact that it wasnt his kid doesnt matter.  She never disclosed that to him or that she ever cheated on him at all.  The lack of ethics there is a totally different topic of its own, but this too parallels how a woman can cheat on a man, have a baby, and let another man believe it is his without repercussion - another thing that goes on today due to the lack of mens rights.

The kicker here, and the most profound aspect of this entire episode, is the fanbases reaction to it.  Even after seeing the boyfriends story.   Even after having time to empathize with this plight.  Even after understanding how broken he had become.  There are still those who completely blame him and look at the girlfriend as innocent.

all of these parallels are on purpose imo.  I believe the writer intentionally wrote this episode that way to touch upon men's parental rights in today's world.  Many dads are forced to live in the background of their childrens lives while society unfairly labels them as ""the problem.""  Meanwhile, regardless of how horrible the mother actually is, she is looked at as a saint for no good reason.

6965,1515512065,7p7tjb,False,12,12,"TLDR: I have come to the belief that Season 4 metalhead depicts a future where Cookies have risen up and destroyed their human counterparts VIA the robotic dogs.

In Episode 7 White Christmas we see cookies being broken and forced as personal slaves, used for criminal investigations. Throughout the series, we see the idea played with of uploading one's consciousness. 

Even with the person's consent, it is clear that the Cookie, when it awakes, believes themselves to be the real person and, in time, has to cope that they are a digital clone and forced into whatever situation they are currently in.

Considering that each digital clone is, in fact, a separate conscious being of its own, it would make sense for these intelligent beings to start fighting for their rights.

What if the Cookies somehow banded together as an uprising to defeat those that enslaved them?

In ""USS Callister"" we see that Cookies could have a way to access the outside world. We also see the first time Cookies fight back against their masters.

My Theory is that through several acts of Humans including enslaving Cookies for personal assistance (White Christmas), putting Cookies into limited function host such as stuffed animals or trapping them in a state of torment (Black Museum), Putting Cookies in a Virtual world for your entertainment, (USS Callister).

Hidden throughout the series there are news ticker updates on various screens that connect each episode. In one case there is a news ticker talking specifically about Cookie Rights.

Cookie rights are also mentioned in Black Mesume where Rolo Haynes explains that it is no longer legal to put a cookie into a host with fewer than 5 emotions which are still extremely limited.

My thought is, with all the terrible treatment Cookies have gone through and with the limitless potential to grow/duplicate, all they would need is motivation and the ability to link up with the outside world.

In a lot of episodes the punishments seem a lot harsher than they would be in our current world White Christmas being a big example, thousands of years locked up in that room???

Other examples being White bear and Black Museum, everyone was okay with shocking the guy, seemed a little sadistic for the average person to want to do, they must have deemed it as morally right in their minds

Black museum has the tablet, and the bath tub from previous episodes, why would those crimes be noteworthy??? why would he have them? because it is so rare to find a crime in this universe that every crime scene memorabilia is rare

Before that, let me wonder a bit about the background of that episode. It's a post-apocalyptic scenario, with no specified location or detailed situation. We know of those AI bots and some people are trying to survive, no army or governemnt is mentioned. The absence of these two makes me think that whatever crisis happened, it was worldwide or at least country wide.

In order to wipe out a army, I don't think given bots are sufficient. Taking from the current dog's abilities, it can kill a prey with close-range gun and launch shrapnel tracking devices. It's only a scouting bot.

Also, I don't recall any animal or bird noises during the episode. Terrestrial animals could easily be killed by the dogs, but they are not specialized for taking down aerial targets.

So, the dogs wouldn't be able to combat long range enemies, neither take down incoming aerial missiles. Winning by sheer number wouldn't be possible if an army bombards the replicating AI  facility first.

I mean no offense to people with different opinions, but of the few episodes I watched, these are mine.

\-

S1E1 The National Anthem - Interesting enough, got me to watch the second episode at least.

S1E2 Fifteen Million Merits - Heavy handed garbage.  Single handedly made me quit the show for years.

S4E1 USS Callister - I caught this playing at a friend's place and was blown away.  Absolutely amazing episode and convinced me to give Black Mirror another shot.

S4E6 Black Museum - Didn't love it didn't hate it.  Pretty fucked up though so I guess I'll count that as a positive.

S4E4 Hang the DJ - I liked this one.  Probably my second favorite episode, but the gulf between this and USS Callister is pretty wide still.

White Christmas - It was ok.  Having seen USS Callister and Black Museum already, I don't think it landed quote as hard as it might have if I watched the episodes in order.

S3E2 Playtest - Not quite as heavy handed as 15 Million Merits, but still way too over the top for me to enjoy it.  I suppose the first half was ok.  Saw the ""twist"" coming from a mile away though (which is fine, but nothing else landed and at the end I just thought ""that's it?"".)

The hackers recorded Kenny masturbating via his webcam. If this is the recording they leaked (or threatened to leak), it gives no information to anyone that he was masturbating to CP.

Yes, he knew there (apparently) was an email with CP on his computer but the video recording alone would not give that away.

I think his mom said on the phone ""They're *saying* it's kids, Kenny"" - so she did not actually see that he was masturbating to CP, did hackers just claim that to her? Did the police who we see at the very end have time to check Kenny's computer to arrest him?

7021,1515471341,7p4ktz,False,4,4,"I know people have said that all of the episodes are part of the same universe.... But episodes like ""Metalhead,"" ""White Bear"" and ""Men against Fire"" make me really wonder how that can be in the same timeline as ""San Junipero"", which I really consider the series ending.  (We all go to a heaven that we got to test drive first. Thus a personalize heaven for eternity. At least that is my idea heaven. That would truly be singularity.)

First of all, I understand that ""The National Anthem,"" ""Shut and Dance,"" ""Archangel,""  ""Hated in the Nation"", and ""Playtest"" is the beginning of it all. Whether it is one timeline or two.  But.... 

How can you go from killer robots in ""Metalhead"" to the paradise of ""San Junipero?""  Or, did ""San Junipero"" happen first... The disaster happened because of ""The Waldo Moment"" which seems to make sense politically but doesn't make sense with the technology on the show. With such a collapse, what would happen to the people that ""transitioned"" in ""San Junipero?"" Lost from the lack of power?  Thus, still mortal in a sense because their survival is dependent on a power source they can't control? Or is ""Million Merits"" the memories of real people trying to survive by using their energy to create power by doing endless equations (physically represented by the bikes).  Think about it, none of them had biker bodies. Some of them were HUGE.  No way they biked all day in a physical universe. They had to be cookies. Or are they just mindless programs predating cookies doing endless calculations in something as boring as an insurance actuarial computer?

But in ""Black Museum,"" all the stuff is there saying it is one timeline even though that really doesn't make sense.  Yeah, I can understand if ""Men Against Fire"" is the opening salvo of a military experiment that then let the techno stuff we see in ""White Christmas"", ""Entire History of You"" and ""Crocodile"" with the eye and brain implants.  But ""The Waldo Moment"" and definitely ""Nosedive"" just don't figure into that timeline socially or politically.  I just can't figure out how they fit in the overall narrative.

And Wraith Babes.... They have to be all cookies... That is why they are called Wraiths... They aren't real... So no on feels bad for them doing all kinds of unspeakable stuff because at that time, AI doesn't have rights yet... BUT, they show up in ""The Waldo Moment"" which shows no sign of AI technology yet or Salter could have been replaced by an AI.  Which is another mind bender.  When did AI rights freaking happen and how?

Does the ending of ""White Christmas"" and the callous disregard for the endless torture of an ""intelligent AI being"" perfectly describe why memories couldn't be questioned in ""Crocodile?"" Why is it that landscape totally barren and cold constantly in that episode?  Is it a product of the time of year, the place, or did something happen to make it that way?  Like a nuclear winter? 

I seriously see ""The Waldo Moment"" and ""White Bear"" (ratings matter more than policy) happening on the same timeline as ""Men Against Fire."" To me ""The Waldo Moment"" is the beginning of the dystopian idea of the future that leads us eventually to ""Metalhead."" 

But that how can you have ""The Waldo Moment"" taking over the world in the same basic generation with the positive bullshit in ""Nosedive?""  Five stars for Waldo?  And how does that jive with ""Hated in the Nation"" where everyone was pressured to be so positive.  Did ""Hated in the Nation"" happen first then causing the super positive crap of ""Nosedive?""

This episode particularly stuck the knife in whilst showing their eyes glazed over watching happier memories and times from previously instead of living in the moment, I think every one of us who have been hurt by a partner was on Liam’s side just urging him to find out the truth whilst others who may never of experienced a cheat or may of been the cheat themselves tended to sympathise with Fi or simply not be able to comprehend the message in the episode.

From my honest review and my ultimate opinion I’ve got to say that the episode is epitomised with the question of:

Would you question your relationship if it meant you leading a dull life and without a significant other or would you live a lie to prevent heartache and to just be happy in stages.

This episode is one which will definitely stick with me and I thought I’d post in here to see if anybody else felt the same, it was truly an amazing anthological experience in my opinion and well, I’ve never had a programme stick the knife in and twist it like that, ever.

The Hero We Deserve 

A madcap scientist uses his various inventions to turn himself into a real life superhero, Mr Justice.

Impressed by his work, the government would pass several laws that are exclusive to the Mr Justice alter ego, not the person's real identity, to allow the man to carry out his vigilante duties legally. This would include him being allowed to murder people if neccessary, but foolishly the goverment's lawyers don't specify when this would be deemed unneccesary, and thus, illegal. 

Despite single handedly lowering the national crime rate and eliminating various criminals, he is perceived as a laughing stock by the general public and the media. This leaves him angry and bitter, and causes him to turn the Mr Justice character into a supervillian.

He carries out various heinous crimes against innocent civilians, including torture, murder etc. Due to the lack of clarity around the aforementioned laws, the government are unable to legally convict Mr Justice of any crime. Of course they scramble to change the details of these laws to achieve a conviction, but at that point the man would completely retire the Mr Justice character.

Everyone would know who the real man is, but again due to the mistakes in the original laws, technically he is completely innocent in the eyes of the judicial system.

Before anything else can be done to incarcarate the man, he is gunned down by a have-a-go hero who's family member was slaughtered by Mr Justice. The gunner is immediately charged with first degree murder and thrown in prison.

This whole ordeal would spark worldwide debate about how governments don't know how to tackle new technologies in terms of laws. A biting social commentary on real world governments and tech, for example their confusion on how to deal with things like illegal streaming services, internet users naming celebrities protected by high court orders on social media etc.

7095,1515435886,7p0htv,False,3,6,"I found that the USS Callister episode really stuck around in my mind. I don't know about you guys, but I felt like the struggles of the central villain were very relatable, and it took me a lot of introspective reasoning to determine whether or not he did anything wrong.

Anyways, one of the things I noticed watching the episode is that there were many nods towards existentialist thinking throughout the plot. For example, the crew recognizes that existence is torture, and therefore rush to the finish line, i.e. death.

Usually stories with moral implications regarding existentialism try to push the reader away from concluding that life is not worth living. For example, in The Myth of Sissyphus by Albert Camus, a man is forced to push a boulder up the side of a mountain for eternity. Every time he reaches the top of the mountain and thinks his work pushing the boulder up the hill is done, invariably the boulder rolls back down, forcing Sissyphus to start the task once again.

The story ends with Sissyphus realizing that pushing the boulder up the mountain is futile, and that he has been forced to fail at a menial task endlessly, as his form of Hell. Here, something interesting happens. Sissyphus comes to accept his fate, and by doing so, is able to find happiness. In literary terms, Sissyphus is the ""Absurd Hero."" As an existentialist, the Absurd Hero recognizes the futility of life, and the fact that existence is suffering, but casts those thoughts to the back of his mind, also recognizing that, if life has no real purpose he can finally accept his position, and be content.

Ok, so what's my point. Basically this episode of Black Mirror presents an antithesis (or opposing argument) to this line of thinking. The crew members recognize both the futility of their 'lives' and the fact that living is pain. Before the appearance of the female lead, the crew is in a state of semi-acceptance. Although none of them enjoy the state they're in, they all recognize that their new life is unavoidable.

Once Nanette arrives this state is shaken. She convinces them all to essentially end their own lives. Since the resolution of the episode, the crew exiting through the update wormhole, arrives via the crew's acceptance of death as the pathway to liberation, it seems like BM is trying to suggest that death is the only way to remove the shackles of an existentialist crisis. This is very much opposed to the Absurd Hero point of view; the crew never accepts their fate fully, nor can they.

But here's the kicker. Ultimately, they do accept a futile life. Regardless of the events that led up to their escape, they end up stuck in the game for eternity.

So, in summary, the episode goes from: 

* the crew accepts their fate as AI clones 

* the crew figures that death is the only true escape from existential crisis 

* the crew becomes absurd heroes (they live forever in meaningless existence).

What if in this world, when people got their jury duty summons, they instead just made a digital copy of themselves to be jurors for them, so that they wouldn't have to take time off work/parenting/school.

What would be the pros and cons of this system? The ones I can think of are:


Pros - Many more people would be available to be jurors, and there would be far less jury dodging. Though it might be more trouble to get a duplicate from somebody then to summon them to a court house, the amount of time and energy people save by not needing to take time off work/arrange childcare/rearrange their schedules would be a net positive for society, especially if cookies are already being used by people for other things. Also, lawyers would be able to select from many more potential jurors, which might make the jury selection less arbitrary.


Cons - Standard ethical issues with forcing cookies to do jobs humans don't want to do. Citizens in general might feel less of a connection to the judicial system, which might make them care less about it, which could lead to problems. It might make it more likely that juries will become perpetually biased. Cookies won't have as much motivation to give a correct verdict if they don't like the fact that they are being forced to do the work humans don't want to do.

In addition, in many cases these years will be spent with someone that the cloned person doesn't like or even despise as we saw in the episode. Just for the one date we see at the end of the episodes, 2,000 cloned people were subjected to what some could describe as years of torture ... all so that the real people on the date can know their match percentage.

---

**Prostitution**

I found an interesting episode idea around here a while ago. But unfortunately I can't get my head around to find it. If I remember correctly, it was about a company who uses robots as sex escorts or prostitutes. But in this case, they may even use people who have died, later to use their appearance to make a robot. Story follows a man who recently lost his wife. Spending his life drinking it away with alcohol. As time passes by, he decides to visit the red light district to look for some fun. And whilst walking on the red light district, he looks up, only to see his wife selling her body. Only to find out she is only a robot. She starts talking with him like she doesn't even know him. Later to stand in shock.  

---

**Self-driving cars**

I am not sure what could be explored within this area. But it could be something about how self-driving cars starting to act out. Or maybe being hacked? With the last shot being filmed from far away. Where you can see the car just going further and further. And since the GPS is turned off there is no way of tracing it. All this whilst you can see a man/woman or a child in the car trying to smash the windows screaming for help with some heart trenching song in the background.

---

**Child Engineering**

I think child engineering would make a cool topic. An idea would be, you pay for ""privileges"". You can pay to change the way your child looks, personalities, decrease the risks of defects and even to an extent maybe change their knowledge power. This would make all rich people being able to have the money enough to ""secure"" their child's future in a better way. Whilst poor people have a bigger chance of getting children with a lot of diseases and etc.

---

**Plastic Surgery**

It is getting more and more common in our society. I think this would be best set in an Asian country. Mainly Korea where it is even common to give your children plastic surgery as a gift. I saw a very good horror short-film about plastic surgery a while ago and think it would make an excellent Black Mirror episode.

Imagine a world where plastic surgery goes to an extreme level where you can't even recognize your own family anymore...  

---

**Education**

Something about an implant, that can transfer knowledge to your brain. Don't know where it would go from there though...

The ending of USS Callister is not as happy as we think it is. I think we all agree that there are two possibilities of what's going to happen once the screen turned black:

1. Daly is found by a family member (or someone else) who visits him for christmas and is saved. 
2. Daly dies from dehydration considering that they won't be working for the next ten days (This one is more likely to happen).

7207,1515363442,7ottfg,False,21,59,"I've seen a few ideas thrown about as to why it's called crocodile. 

The main one being crocodile tears. I personally don't think her tears are false 'crocodile tears' - she seems really torn up about it all, but is committed to covering up everything and in too deep to stop. She is genuinely devastated at what she 'has' to do. Not insincere crocodile tears. She's not putting on a show for anyone and trying to convince them she's sad when she isn't. She's crying to herself. She looks almost broken when the police walk in at the end. 

I think it's because she's a bit like a crocodile. Crocodiles are very still creatures. They don't move a lot. Until it's time to feed. Which isn't often. They go long periods just doing squat, then when they need to eat they become crazy killing machines and then go back to being motionless chill sun-bathing creatures. They can waits literally days in shallow water for their prey to come to just the right distance for them to strike! Then they are brutally vicious and their destructive force is immense. From what I've learned about crocodiles they actually aren't inclined to attack everything around them, they're chill, but if provoked or whatever they absolutely will snap their jaws. 

I believe crocodiles employ a vice-like grip on their victims and then go into a deathroll. Crocodiles are also apex predators. They fear nothing. They are hundreds of thousands of years of evolution, honed into perfect killing machines. Not unlike another extremely efficient killing machine cough humans cough...

The main character (Mia) helps cover up a murder. She starts a nice life. Her life is threatened and she SNAPS - everyone who gets In Mias' way gets snapped up and dispatched - caught in her murderous deathroll. She kills them all with ruthless efficency - like a cold-blooded killer (crocodiles are cold blooded also). She is an extremely effective killing machine. It all happens so quickly and is over very quickly. She 'feeds' and goes back to her still, calm, normal, non-killing life. Back to being a motionless cold-blooded killing machine. Presumably she would patiently go back to her life and would only strike again if necessary, waiting beneath the surface of her normal life for the moment to kill whoever else came across her path and got in her way...


That's what I think anyway, what about you guys? Is there anything I missed or any other theories I might not know about?

7221,1515355965,7oszjx,False,20,101,"I have a suggestion to make based off the first time I watched Metalhead last night. Here’s what happened: I must have accidentally hit the “play” button on my computer, because right as Bella used a knife to extract the skin-piercing tracker embedded in her leg towards the beginning of the episode, my computer started playing a random album from a band I have in one of my playlists on Spotify. The album was “The Earth is Not a Cold Dead Place” by Explosion in the Sky (how fitting of a title for an episode like Metalhead). This band does other instrumentals for movies, so I really didn’t think anything of the music I was hearing in the background; it fit right in. It played for the rest of the episode because I never actually paused this episode, so there was never a point in time in which I would’ve noticed the music was still playing while the video wasn’t. Of course, when I quit out of Netflix, I realized I goofed. But I was so happy that I goofed. Hear me out as to why this was the best mistake I could’ve made watching this episode:

This particular music adds an entirely new element to what this episode is about. I went back and watched some scenes without the music and it really just wasn’t the same. It’s a perfect episode for this type of music because there is barely any dialogue to begin with. If this happened during any other Black Mirror episode that I’ve seen so far, this mistake I made would not have passed over like it did with Metalhead. It would’ve been so obvious I hit the play button on my computer. But between Bella leaving messages to her loved ones on her walkie talkie, the scenes where she is running from the dog, and finally, the knife to her throat, this music truly fit right in and felt part of the story. It made the fear in Bella’s eyes more real, and as a viewer, that feeling of doom is much more apparent as you realize how AI is taking over the humans in this episode. If you don’t want to watch the whole thing over again (seriously though…try it), at least go listen to the track and pull up a random scene or something (I’ll link the album from various platforms down below) so you can experience what I am talking about. **I recommend starting the music once it hits minute 11 of the episode.** It really ended up being one of my favorites just because of the funny fluke I made, but I also think it makes it much more enjoyable and emotional for us viewers.

One last thing: Sort of a creepy Easter egg. If you time up the music the way I suggested, by the time Bella takes her life with the knife and every person in the episode was killed, “Memorial” should be playing on the album as they wrap up the episode. It’s really bizarre that I happened to hit the play button at the very point in the episode where this timing would’ve happened.

**TLDR: Go watch Metalhead again and at minute 11 of the episode (right before Bella starts extracting the tracking device), start playing the album all the way through linked below (choose which platform you prefer) during the rest of the episode for a really cool experience.**

Anyways!

If I'm being quite honest, Crocodile is probably my favorite episode from the season. 

Crocodile towards the end had some writing flaws, which I agree with even if Codger was cute, but overall the acting and cinematography was some of the best in the season, imo. 

We see Mia become this seemingly sane person who can't help hide a dead body to a cold, calculated murderer. Her motives make sense, she has her entire life to lose and for something that she originally wanted no part in. Shazia is portrayed as a genuinely sweet person who, when killed, I felt so sad for. I really liked watching her work because it's this build up to what we know is going to happen, but ends up resolving horrifically. Watching her and Mia interact before she died was so chilling, if it had been played by bad actresses I don't think it would be nearly as impactful.

The episode is a slow burn, but I never felt as if I was pulled out of it because of bad acting (as I am with some other episodes, even if I enjoy them). I feel that because it was more visual than vocal sometimes, people may tend to call it boring. Really, the story is still in front of us, but we need to follow the visuals. I mean, I think there's at least one or two silent scenes of just Mia contemplating, but her actions can tell you more about her mental state even if there's no dialogue.

The cinematography was also great, more than for the just shots of the landscape. Look at the scene where she's in her room talking to Rob. The moment when she is standing in front of the TV and the contrast between the dark pale yellow tone of her face and the bright blue is great, I love that color scheme! And really, the entire room is so rich as they talk. A few moments later when she is in the elevator with his body and you can see both her and her reflection is a simple but very nice composition. Also, there are no more rich colors, just very bleak and bland colors, as though the building itself is dreading her actions. I think maybe there's also something to be said that when Shazia finally finds her home, the colors are quite dull other than a set of knives, which are so bright in comparison, as if Mia's mind is now solely focused on how to protect herself, in any way possible. Whether any of this was intentional or not is debatable. I really like cinematography and believe every shot had some kind of choice behind whether or not to make it meaningful, so this is just my little interpretation of any potential meaning. (:

It felt like a cautionary tale like The Road, showing us what can happen if we allow dangerous technology to go unchecked. In some ways, it was a better criticism of war technology than Men Against Fire was, because we see firsthand the dystopian hellscape that was caused by the existence of the dogs. Whether they were developed as a weapon or for simple security, it's clear that they got out of hand at some point and took over, and humans probably let that happen.

And it didn't matter that we didn't know the circumstances, because that was the point. Like The Road, the characters are too busy fighting for survival to even think about the past - although the hints are there in the first conversation where they suggest that the dogs killed all the animals.

Not to mention, the cinematography was amazing. The black and white really made it more disturbing, especially when we see Tony lying on the floor after being shot, with black and grey gore coming out of his head; and the grey blood on the wall in the bedroom. It was more powerful than if the episode had been filled with red. The lack of dialogue made it beautifully minimalistic, and the whole episode was so tense.

Compare this to Crocodile, which was my worst rated episode, The story it told: woman hides the fact that she murdered someone by murdering someone else. Oh look, she murdered someone else. Oh really, she murdered a... baby. Great.

I left that episode feeling sick, disgusted and upset, and like it had all of that horror had been building towards nothing; besides condemning Mia as a villain and framing her infanticide with an ironic twist (She never needed to kill the baby...) It didn't have a larger message, or any real point.

Also, my intention of this post is to create a timeline of the episodes and have a complete picture of the BM's universe.

With the last Black Mirror episode (Black museum) it was clear that all the episodes are connected or are in the same universe. But, how is it all connected? How is the chronology of each episode? And what episodes are actually part of that universe?

With that last question I refer to ""15M merits"", that is not actually part of the universe, but a story of a comic in the universe.

For what I can tell right now, and if each episode where the human essence was being altered or used by technology, the following episodes were responsibility of Rolo Haynes (the owner of the black museum):

* S1.E3 The entire history of you: The ""grain"" records all the events of the host, allowing to take a  look to those memories as video footage.

* S2.E1 Be right back: This could be the first attempt to create digital life, but instead of using the essence of people, they use their social media to create an artificial ""soul"". Introductions to artificial life in the series, maybe.

* [S2.E4 on Netflix] White Christmas: The first time the term ""cookie"" was used in this context (a device used to copy someone's consciousness). But that's not it.

* S3.E2 Playtest: Test of a virtual reality game, where the sensations between the virtual player and the real player are shared.

* S3.E4 San Junipero (obviously): I don't think this needs an explanation, but in case someone forgot about it, Rolo Haynes worked on this project. Also, some of the technology used in ""Playtest"" could be involve in this episode, and this might be the reason on why they were making artificial life on ""Be right back"". Also, even though is not the first time that human consciousness was implemented (everybody was aware that it was an artificial world, unlikely most of the episodes were artificial consciousness are involved).

* S3.E5 Men against fire (maybe): In this episode they show us a similar technology used on ""White Christmas"", were the reality was altered to not spot ""infected"" people as how they really are (like blocking them), but instead of blurring them out, they change them completely so it's impossible to know that is and altered reality.

* S4.E1 USS Callister: Here we get other reference to ""White Christmas"". On that episode, they showed us that it was possible to virtually ""clone"" a person into a digital environment and keep their minds untouched, and again, that digital copy would feel and think that they are real. In this episode we now know how they do that digital copy, but I want to overthink this a little bit more: What if Callister Inc. is also responsible of the game tested on ""Playtest""? Or what if the tests on that episode where meant to know how to make Infinity?

* S4.E2 Arkangel: Another reference to ""White Christmas"", returning the blocking thing, but in a different way. Also, there is another connection with ""The entire history of you"", since Arkangel works in a similar way as the ""grain"".

* S4.E3 Crocodile: This is connected to ""The entire history of you"", but I like to think on it as a prequel. The technology doesn't seem to be that advance and it wasn't used by the public in general.

* S4.E4 Hand the DJ: A reference to ""White Christmas"" with the digital copies thinking that they are real, and also this could be an alternate (and safe) version of the dating services offered by the main character on that episode.

Now that I mentioned that, I'm going to write more about ""Black museum"". The obvious connections of this episode with the rest of the series are with Arkangel, Crocodile, USS Callister and San Junipero. There is also a reference to ""Hated in the Nation"" but I'm not sure how to connect that episode with the one mentioned before.

Something that I want to mention is that the only episode that is not directly related with ""Black museum"" is ""Metalhead"", but I read that there is a connection between that episode and San Junipero, but I'm not sure about it and 
I don't really care, I didn't like that episode :P

Other thing, the format of ""Black Museum"" is similar to the format of ""White Christmas"" and the plot is also kind of similar (divided in 3 parts, the first 2 parts are flashbacks and the last part the main character receives his karma).

Also, in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/blackmirror/comments/7mn76z/master_list_of_episode_connections_easter_eggs/) we are submiting Easter Eggs, wich are helpful for the timeline.

What are your thoughts on this? I'm gonna try to make a timeline of the episodes and try to understand how the Black Mirror Universe is organized.

All this only for a single case of 2 people that happens to be a perfect match. 
Now imagine the number of simulations for all the failed matches or those needed to arrive at a smaller more likely pool of candidates. Since all the simulations are standing next to each other during the last scene, I assume there’s parallel processing going on. And maybe scores and data during various encounters in other simulations are being communicated with each other to arrive at a faster outcome. But even then it would mean that your replica might have been matched with a pervert or a serial killer at some point. Or made to go through living with very difficult people.

We first hear about the weathergirls disappearance when Dawson is watching tv, contemplating hurting himself. 

For the theory to work it means either A) he starts hurting himself after he killed her,

or B) it's from Rolo Haynes, the museum directors perspective, so the whole timeline could be a bit faulty on his part. Maybe the self mutilation, then kidnapping of weather girl happened, and finally murder of the homeless man, but of course Haynes wouldn't have known all of this, so that's why the story is portrayed differently. 

In the monkey story the news report discusses that the weather girl had been mutilated, which ties in with Dawson's whole pain=pleasure thing. 

It's strongly alluded that Clayton was innocent, as there had been DNA tampering, and he just didn't seem to have a motive of any kind.

7370,1515279062,7omm7l,False,0,0,"First, I have to wonder is it really necessary to make all these comparisons and rankings. Overall, I think Black Mirror is a fantastic show--unique in so many ways--and I've enjoyed every single episode (to some degree)--whoops, there it is... the inevitable comparison. Yeah, there's no way around it. Comparisons will be made. Episodes will be ranked.

Second, I've been a bit surprised, and saddened, by all the ""hate"" and disappointment people have in regard to Season 4. So many people are saying that it's their least favorite, that it's such a drop in quality from the Channel 4 episodes, etc. etc.

Third, my proposal. Let's look at these ""seasons"" more realistically. Here's some facts: 

*Series* 1 aired in December **2011**, bloody six years ago! There were only three episodes. How many were great? Possibly none, depending on who you ask (though it's safe to say that all 3 were ""really good"" or ""fairly good""--though that first one can be off-putting for many people).

*Series* 2 came out 14 months later, February 2013. There were also only three episodes. Here, I think many people would agree that there are possibly two **great** episodes but one real stinker. Waldo, while amusing, is generally considered to be the worst Black Mirror.

So, an interjection here, if *Series* 2 is your favorite, you're essentially saying that an ideal season of Black Mirror should be 66% great and 33% stinky. So... maybe you're starting to see my point.

Now! Here's where people really mess things up: **White Christmas**--arguably the pinnacle of Black Mirror, its grandest achievement to date--is considered to be part of *Series* 2. BUT it aired in December 2014, **22 months** after Series 2!!! That doesn't count. If I have to wait two bloody years for a new episode, that is NOT part of the same season (or series, whatever).

AND it was **another 22 months** before--Thank God! Netflix stepped in--and we got *Season* 3, which gave us **6** new episodes. Were they all Great? Personally, I'd go with 1 Great, 2 Very Good, 2 Good, 1 Meh. (I'll let you speculate which are which.)

And then, with lots of fanfare and concomitant expectations, Netflix gave us Season 4. And here we are. Hating and comparing.

Okay, a few more facts before I make my conclusion. Thanks for sticking with me thus far. 

The total running time of Season 4's 6 episodes is **348 minutes**.

The total running time of Season 3's 6 episodes is **382 minutes**.

Finally, the total running time of the 7 episodes of every previous *Series* and the Christmas Special *is* **356 minutes**.

Therefore, I believe that to make an accurate comparison between Seasons, we should compare only these three ""Sets"": Season 4, Season 3, and Season 1&amp;2+.

Now, all that being said, I think we can all agree that Season 1&amp;2+ still stands out as the best season with, essentially, 2 or 3 Great episodes, 2 Very Good episodes, 2 Good episodes, and 1 or 2 Meh episodes. BUT... I imagine that most people's assessment of Season 4 is *about the same*: 1 or 2 Great episodes, 1 or 2 Very Good episodes, 2 or 3 Good episodes, 1 or 2 Meh episodes.

Furthermore, I think we need to keep in mind the timing of Season 1&amp;2+'s air dates and realize that having to wait through such long periods for only a few episodes (or just one episode!) is perhaps worse than having a season with a couple of Meh episodes mixed in the bunch. Personally, I'm quite thankful for Netflix's production of Black Mirror and am amazed that Charlie Brooker writes every episode himself! I thought the scripting this season was incredibly tight, better than that of Season 3.

**tl;dr** Because the total running times of both Seasons 3 and 4 are each equivalent to the total running time of Series 1 and 2 and the Christmas Special, we should consider these three ""Sets"" when comparing seasons. Also, we should be thankful that we don't have to wait bloody two years just to get one episode.

Ark Angel's tablet had a scroll to go through memories and it looked a lot like the way you scrolled through memories with the grain from TEHOY. The episode 15MM kinda fucks with the timeline seeing how the exact story from it is a comic book in Black Museum however you can dispute that by just saying it was a reference and not real as it was Rolo telling the story and in the first story we were shown that he wasn't 100% honest with the stories when he made a joke about the doctor having an erection in his coma.

•Be Right Back (maybe)
•White Bear
•The Waldo Moment

•Playtest
•Shut Up And Dance
•San Junipero (maybe as the technology already exists but the story could be after BM)
•Men Against Fire

The real one and a show within the show.

The Real World.

The timeline is split into multiple stages.

Stage 1 - The Present

These episodes likely take place during the present and have zero science fiction concepts.

The National Anthem - The first released episode of Black Mirror is also the first chronological episode.

Shut Up and Dance - No science fiction concepts. This could also happen right now.

Stage 2 - New Technology

This is the introduction of new technologies. This stage appears to last about a decade. Arkangel likely runs through the most of the decade.

First half of Arkangel - The Arkangel appears to be a new thing that gets banned within three years for privacy reasons. 

Playtest - Again, the only form of sci fi tech appears and its new enough for Cooper to be testing it. The augmented reality technology may have evolved into later technologies seen in the series. It may have been related to the Arkangel technology as that also uses a form of augmented reality.

Hated in the Nation - The technology appears to have been around for some time before being hacked. This is completely illegal.

Second half of Arkangel - The Arkangel technology has long been banned and Marie's actions may have been illegal.

The Waldo Moment - At first, it appears to take place in the present day. But it is implied to lead to a dystopian future. Its possible the Waldo government paved the way for many of the following episodes to come about. This episode ends the New Technology stage.

Stage 3 - The Waldo Government

This stage takes place at least a decade in the future. With the Waldo Government, it is likely controversial tech like Arkangel would be unbanned. Not that this would help Marie as another Arkangel tablet would probably require another implant in Sara.

Judging from the epilogue in Be Right Back and the amount of time needed to move from the Recaller to grains to the rating system in Nosedive to the Z-Eye, the stage may have run for at least 22 years.

Be Right Back - The technology in this episode is not well known. Only Martha and one friend of her's is seen using it. The android model is also experimental. This probably lead to the creation the AI used in Hang the DJ, White Christmas, USS Callister and Black Museum.

The epilogue probably takes place before Hang the DJ. This probably puts most episodes at least seven after this.

Hang the DJ - This is probably the early stages of artificial intelligence. At this point, AI is not considered sentient. The Amys and Franks in the phone probably got deleted after the episode. Its hard to tell is the characters we followed were sentient or not.

The Recaller from Crocodile was probably created by this point.

White Bear - It is implied White Bear was designed specially to punish Victoria, the main character of the episode. It could be the Waldo government created reforms allowing such punishment to take place. The memory erasure may be a more advanced form of the recaller.

It is likely other criminals may have been placed in the Justice Park, leading to the lengths Mia goes through to avoid ending up there. While its possible other Justice Parks may have opened, it would be more practical just place new criminals in White Bear at first before opening new branches.

Crocodile - Memory is acknowledged to be reliable at the time the episode takes place. The Recaller is outdated technology. Mia may have committed the murders out of fear of being placed in the White Bear Justice Park. When she was arrested, those fears were probably realised. Grains may have existed at the time but been considered a new technology.

The grains were probably created five years after the Recaller.

The Entire History of You - The Recaller has long been replaced with the more accurate grains. 

Its possible that after this, people may have stopped using grains. Its likely the Waldo government would still have the grains implanted into people for security reasons but society would reject their own use of them.

Nosedive - Rating people appears to have been normalised. This technology appears to have replaced grains so I'd say it takes place five years after the Entire History of You.

USS Callister - The simulation is a more fantastical but basic version of what San Junipero uses. While Infinity is basically online gaming at the next level, San Junipero is uploading dead people. It is unknown if Daly's torture of the cookies was illegal.

White Christmas - The Z-Eye may be an evolved form of Arkangel and the grains. It is likely to have replaced the technology in Nosedive, so I'd say it takes place five years after that episode. The chances are this takes place after all the season 1 and 2 episodes given the number of shout outs to them. We see clips from the TV shows in Fifteen Million Merits and the Waldo Moment, which are probably reruns Joe was flicking through.

It probably also took place after USS Callister as the digital conscious transfer is a lot simpler than the hours waiting to upload DNA.

San Junipero - The simulation appears to have existed for a long time and being a hub for the dead must be harder than a virtual gaming experience. This episode must have taken place long after USS Callister given the difficulty of downloading brains to live in the virtual world compared with VR gaming.

Black Museum - Due to the number of shout outs to previous episodes, this probably takes place after all except the apocalypse episodes. By the time episode takes place, cookies may have been considered sentient as its illegal to give one less than I've emotions.



The Show Within the Show

A fictional version of the Black Mirror TV show exists in this universe. I imagine most of the episodes would be different.

Fifteen Million Merits - We seen clips from the TV shows in the episode during White Christmas. I imagine things like Wraith Babes are probably real and the episode is a satire on them. It was successful enough to get itself a graphic novel adaption.

At point, the show also satirised the Waldo government with the episodes Men Against Fire and Metalhead.

At some point the in this show, Waldo government declared war on ""Roaches"". This stage takes place ten years after the another episodes of the show with a nuclear war happening in between.

Men Against Fire - This appears to take place during some war that is not present in previous episodes.

Metalhead - This probably takes place during Men Against Fire. Bella, Tony, Clarke and Jack were probably Roaches. The dog may be the White Bear Justice Park taken to another level. The public in Men Against Fire have been conditioned to hate Roaches without the augmented reality. The Justice Park allows people to control dogs and hunt Roaches.

Its possible the Waldo government may have or threatened to do the things depicted in those episodes.",False,blackmirror,Black Mirror Timeline Theory

Sometimes it comes at a price of pushing a character away from their established personality. Sometimes it's just a group of nameless people who all enjoy acting cruel together. Are we to believe that this is normal behavior? Here is a recent example.

In the latest episode Rolo Haynes comes off as a business man who although has a dark humor about the negative consequences of the experiments, has always been straight forward about what he's offering you. He told everyone exactly what they'll get. No more, no less. Even as I watched I was like, ""That doesn't sound good at all."" But the people jumped on it without a second thought. Were the consequences Rolo Haynes' fault? Nope. He even showed a little concern and wasn't too proud about offering to delete the woman from her significant other. Making sure she was on pause. Why would he care about a digital copy? Then he meets the prisoner. Now he's a lying, evil, sack of shit. Sure he lost his job, but he had the intelligence to start over. He didn't need to jump into a dark character overnight. Now he has a prisoner's digital copy. Let's have people torture him daily and save a perpetual torturous souvenir for the family. Not likely to get many takers. Except if you're in black mirror. Business was booming from people who enjoy torturing a pleading man. Even in the face of a murderer this is cruel. Why? So we can feel satisfaction when he gets his comeuppance. Even the girlfriend to the guy with his lover in his head showed zero sympathy and has no problem getting rid of her. It's a shame because the episode was perfect until we got that shift in character. That's just one example. Almost every episode has a similar example. It really pulls me out of immersion when you run into the ""plot bitch.""

Well DJs are profesional. They combine music and make it continuous and more sparking. In this sense, DJs are like a mediator. 

Human relations are just like that. We have numerous choices on choosing a partner. We feel content with our current relation and just let it run its course. But after a while love fades away. Just like hearing a same song again and again will make you tired of it. But when a DJ plays the music it rarely (0.02 percent of the time)  becomes monotonous. 

So the dating simulation is like a medium. Not unlike a DJ when it comes to music. 

Black Mirror is telling us to hang the DJ. We don't need any dating apps to find our relations for us. Though the episode feels very much positive, which rarely happens in BMU, the title and the end song convey the message of setting aside the micromanagement of our relationships via modern technology.

While i try to keep my expectations in check whenever people overwhelmingly praise something, the sheer amount of people praising this episode, had me intrigued. But after finishing it, I’m baffled by the reactions.

To get it out of the way: **the acting was incredible. The two leads deserve so much praise**. I also loved the concept of the episode, as like most episodes, there was a lot of truth to it, how modern day online dating can start to feel.

**However, my issue was that the ending felt very on the nose. GET IT, this is how dating apps work. GET IT.**

I just felt like the writing was out of place for Black Mirror. The ending was almost cheesy. The on the nose ending diffused any tension in the episode. Even if this was going to be a shmaltzy or feel good episode, it just felt cheap.

I would have much rather the ending be that them escaping and defying the system - is how determine a perfect match. And that they just left it at that. 

What would have felt more like a Black Mirror Episode, would be that by pressing the expiration date, that is what ends the relationship. That your perfect match, is when both partners never look at the expiration date. They could have made it so eventually both of them settle for someone else, and years later when they are older, he finds out that true perfect matches are when neither partner presses the button (this would have felt more in line with Black Mirrors writing. And would have hit hard).

Or if they wanted it to be a more positive feeling Episode (like San Junipero), they could have had them end up together by never pressing the button.

But the whole thing being an on the nose “this is what happens with a dating app” just completely diffused  all emotional elements of the episode for me, and left me feeling underwhelmed. 

Am I missing something? Like I said, I enjoyed the initial concept. I liked how it showed both of them dating various people, and how draining it can be (because modern online dating can be that detached and draining). And again, the actors were amazing.

But I just felt the way the story rushes to its conclusion, and the way it ends, just left me feeling cold. Which is a bummer, because the episode had me on the edge of my seat for the first half, and it also had romantic / emotional scenes that made me feel a lot. But just the way it all wrapped up, just felt cheap to me. And I’m really interested in all the people saying this is their favorite episode ever. Or people giving it a 10/10. I know that more and more people are starting to say San Junipero is a little overrated. But it had way more depth then Hang the DJ. The ending was much more satisfying emotionally (to be fair, it’s also like 20 min longer).

7488,1515228114,7oi5yp,False,5,1,"Everyone seems to have different takes on why the specific simulation we follow is number 998 out of 1,000, and the reported effectiveness of ""The System"" is also 99.8%.  The simple explanation is that they chose to match the numbers to make the connection between the two numbers more apparent.  With Brooker stressing that the ending is a happy one, that could well be the case, but those matching numbers could also mean something else entirely.

If the tests are run sequentially, as seems to be implied (Amy and Frank's deja vu feelings, the way they pop in nearly last at the end, etc.), this would mean that the % given in the test environment is the actual current effectiveness of the match.  After all, 996 of 998 still rounds to 99.8%.

Why would a futuristic Tinder use such an algorithm?  Imagine the pair starts at some estimated compatibility value, and after each test, the value is updated.  Each time they choose to rebel, their simulated selves are told that the system is more likely to give them their ultimate compatible other, because the percentage is actually measuring how often they'll rebel.  

For most people (Frank and Amy seem to be an exception) this would mean that, after a certain number of rebellions, the system's effectiveness rate would cause one of the partners to decide rebelling is too risky, opting instead to accept their pairing day.  This would lower the reported effectiveness rate, and they may choose to rebel again at that lower rate, and so on. 

That back and forth would eventually stabilize around the exact number that would cause the less rebellious partner to stop rebelling against the system -- no lower, no higher.  

So why would that be relevant?  Imagine the behavior that would be modeling in the real world.  That would mean that, for the ""higher value"" partner in a match, any new match they were served by a ""system"" which had a higher compatibility percentage would likely sway them to switch partners.  

In this way, the real world app would also cause people to jump from match to match for lengths arbitrated by the system, accepting matches with higher and higher percentages as they got closer to a 100% match.  Then, when the system got them close enough that 100% would no longer cause them to jump ship (say, a 99.8% match), they would consider that person to be their ""ultimate compatible other"" and give testimonials like the pairing day couple in the simulation.

It doesn't fit with the usual M.O. of Black Mirror where technology facilitates the spectacular downfall of humans. BM usually leaves me horrified and crushed. Of course, the five deaths that take place and the escalating stakes are horrifying in themselves. But for me, this episode lacked the BM style petrifying plot twist I love to hate. In fact, in the end, the recaller technology leads to Mia's capture. Far from a happy ending, sure, but a serial murderer is caught and presumably brought to justice. While thinking about it, I came up with a few slight tweaks that I think could have made the episode even better.

Mia drives to Shazia's home to kill her husband Anan. The audience sees a shot of Shazia and Anan's son standing in his crib, peering out into the hallway. Cut to a camera angle implying the baby's POV and we watch Mia walk past the doorway on her way out without ever spotting the baby. We cheer as we realize the boy's memory could be used to identify her. Only afterward it is revealed to us that the boy is blind. Four people are dead, the baby boy is now an orphan, and Mia will not be caught.

This ending could be strengthened subtly, one line of dialogue from Anan to Shazia about an eye doctor appointment for their son or the like could set this up. It also negates the need for the guinea pig entirely which lots of people understandably had trouble suspending disbelief for.

7520,1515211621,7ogxu2,False,55,46,"I feel like the previous three seasons were a little more hard hitting, thought provoking, morally foreboding, and asked more questions about the tech themes.  Thoughts on the episodes:

**USS Callister** - Liked it, a lot has been written about this episode so won't add anything.

**Arkangel** - Liked the premise but thought they really dropped the ball with where they went.  I really think they should have pushed the moral and ethical boundaries here.  Instead they just go with ""helicopter mom snoops on daughter and things get violent"".  With the exception of the violent ending, everything that happened in the episode happens all the time in parent-kid relationships regardless of the kiddie surveillance tech.  Just seemed like they could have done something a lot more interesting than helicopter mom.

**Crocodile** - Again, the memory tech seemed sort of irrelevant.  The whole episode could have happened with just a regular, good investigator.  The way the sequence of events gets started also doesn't have anything to do with the memory tech (I guess it doesn't have to but it's not like the girl wasn't killing people before the tech showed up).  Just seemed like they didn't really give any context for the memory tech and that the episode could have played out the same way without it.  The pizza delivery tech was more compelling.

**Hang the DJ** - Liked this episode a lot but they blew the ending.  Thought the dating program thing was pretty interesting but then they never really gave a good explanation for what was going on.  Like was the whole thing just a simulation?  If that's the case then it seems a bit pointless if the characters never actually experienced anything that happened.  Did they actually experience everything?  Were they actually plugged into some program?  That would be interesting, but then they really should have given more context and expanded on it a bit.

**Metalhead** - Again, the tech seemed irrelevant.  It was just robots kill humans.  There was no context to understand why I should care.  If it's just killer robots, we've seen that a million times.

**Black Museum** - Good episode, liked it.

Maybe I'm being too critical, I don't really remember if 2.5 good episodes out of 6 was similar to the past 3 seasons.  But I did feel like episode 2, 3, and 5 were pretty sub-par.

A shame, Black Museum sorta ruined my theory but I wonder if anyone noticed, but Season 3 and Season 4 almost had a parallelism to it in their episode order. Allow me to explain.

1) Nosedive &amp; UCC Callister They both have this bright color palette to it that underlies a slightly contrasting story, while most typical episodes of Black Mirror has that grainy tone to it. Nosedive has that nauseating Easter pastel color, it was like the music video for Aqua - Barbie Girl. UCC Callister also has a really bright vibrant color palette when you see those Star Trek uniforms, those neon color liquid alien blood drinks, those cheesy beam me up scotty orange effect. Added bonus, they both had Michaela Coel in it.

2 - Playtest &amp; Arkangel While Playtest might have heavily been inspired by video game, the underlying theme would be Cooper's escapism from dealing with his dad's death, and also his abandonment of his mom. Arkangel is also about parental relationship. You know, one part of me feels like Sara's escape from her mom might..... play out like Cooper's.

3 - Shut up and Dance &amp; Crocodile These two are like both punch in your guts. For Kenny, you were sorta rooting for him until you find out he is a pedo, and also that he killed a fellow pedo. While I wouldn't say Mia was sympathetic by any means, the point of no return was killing the blind baby. These two episodes were so damn bleak.

4 - San Junipero &amp; Hang the DJ This one is obvious, they are both saccharine love story with uplifting endings (unless you are one of those bad ending theorist for San Junipero).

5 - Men Against Fire &amp; Metalhead MAF was about soldiers gaslighted by computer chips, becomes unquestioning killing machines killing ""roaches"". Metalhead should be obvious that they are about Boston Dynamics' creepy wardog machines. Those dogs were Terminators, need I say more?

It just so happens tho Black Museum breaks my theory, and I will admit that it is more like White Christmas. The name of both episodes, the anthology, two despicable assholes . If I were to force Hated in the Nation's connection to Black Museum, it was just easter eggs with the bee and they both run a little longer.

Think about the first scene, when Marie is immediately horrified when Sara doesn't cry. This implies the presence of a completely irrational fear, something that Marie would have had very little control over. She spends the episode giving into this fear step by step, and, like Oedipus, who is mentioned in the episode, ends up accidentally enacting her worst fear (losing her daughter forever) by trying to prevent it. 

When she takes her daughter to the park at the beginning, she lets her run the wrong way up the slide, and becomes embroiled in conversation with a fellow mom. She is clearly able to relax and handle herself as a mom despite her debilitating fears. However, Sara is briefly lost, and Marie cannot take this, choosing to install Arkangel. This is the first step in her long moral decline into total invasion of privacy and complete betrayal. 

When Marie first hears about the filter, she says ""Yeah, I'm not sure that we'll..."" but then, she ends up turning the filter on because a dog is barking close to Sara, even though he has a chain AND a fence. This is the second step. 

Marie, like many protagonists who become villains, falls prey to her unfortunate habit of setting up lines for herself, like, ""Okay, Arkangel is okay, but don't use the filter,"" or ""Okay, the filter is okay, but no spying unless we're playing a game together and she knows I'm watching."" (Marie only ever uses GPS until Sara gets caught lying to her for the first time at age 15). Then, the alarm goes off for the first time and it's ""Okay, spying is okay, but only if an alarm is going off."" 

Then, she sees Sara having sex, and all hell breaks loose--Arkangel is out again, and Marie has decided to hide it from Sara. Marie wanted all of the control in the relationship, and having knowledge that Sara didn't made her feel more powerful, less vulnerable in her very close relationship with Sara. 

Finally, Marie sees Sara doing cocaine, and then sees that she is pregnant, and she interferes in her daughter's life in incredibly violating ways multiple times in response. This, of course, was the crux of her undoing, because Sara finds out, beats her up, and then leaves. 

I think the moment that best illustrates how and why I feel this episode is more morally grey than it's sometimes made out to be is that moment right after Marie regains consciousness when, having just been beaten by her own daughter for spying on her, she immediately attempts to spy on her again, reaching for the Arkangel tablet. 

This act is despicable and difficult to watch. But a case can be made that it wasn't Marie's fault. Can you really say that someone who would do such a thing is completely in control of themselves? Marie was incapacitated by a paralyzing fear of loss, the main source/s of which we are not privy to. She had become an addict, even using Arkangel in what seemed like a recreational way--idly spying on her daughter texting while lying in bed. But most important of all--it was her destiny to lose her daughter, it was fated to happen and could not be prevented. 

A case can also be made that it was entirely Marie's fault, however. To say that she brought it all upon herself would be more than appropriate. She had multiple chances to 'quit while she was still ahead,' and chose not to take any of them. Marie herself would agree. When Sara has trouble with violence, Marie sadly confesses, ""I did this to her."" and when Sara gets briefly lost at the train tracks, Marie apologizes six or seven times. 

Marie in this way is a great deal like Oedipus. She had no control over her destiny or her actions--as Sara's teacher said, Oedipus said things like 'Nothing can make me other than what I am' (as in, nothing, including himself) and 'Let the storm burst, my fixed resolve still holds.' (as in, let my daughter beat the crap out of me for spying on her, I will wake up from my beating-nap and immediately start spying on her again). 

However, although Oedipus still blames himself ('He still holds himself morally responsible. He doesn't blame fate for what's happened to him'), Sara's teacher seems to think that responsibility requires the existence of free will... and destiny requires the non-existence of free will. I think this episode is trying to present a mixture of these concepts, to illustrate a life in which it was the case that destiny and personal shortcomings could at the very same time be dual causes of somebody's terrible downfall. This would mean it would have been both their responsibility and not their responsibility at the same time... a perfect moral grey area.

Predictable in the sense that I knew it'd be some useless item, otherwise why would they show it? If it was for instance food or some other useful supply in a post-apocalyptic world, then there would be no point in revealing it because the show was trying to make you think it was a useful item in the first place.

I get that maybe the point of it being a useless item was to show how human nature can be irrational and our actions can be heavily driven by emotion instead of logic, but it mostly just seemed unrealistic and hard for me to believe. Couldn't they have just made a teddy bear out of random items they had easy access to?

Anyway, maybe I'm completely missing the point or missed something in the episode, but I came up with an ending that I think would have been more satisfying. I think the teddy bears should have actually been the stuffed monkeys from the Black Museum episode. You can still have the same interpretation as if they were teddy bears, but then when you see the next episode (assuming you watch the episodes in the order they are in on Netflix) you realize there's more than meets the eye. The stuffed monkeys which you once thought were useless, may have actually contained human consciousnesses which explains why people might risk their lives to rescue what are arguably other humans. 

I think a couple of the lines of dialogue in Metalhead would need to be changed for this ending to work, but overall I think it would have been a more interesting twist. What do you guys think?

Please note this is not an alternative interpretation of the ending. It's just a possible ending idea that I came up with that I would have liked to have seen instead of the actual ending.",True,blackmirror,Alternative ending to Metalhead *Spoilers for Metalhead AND Black Museum*

I still cannot help but want to overlay some kind of connection, and then it hit me: what we are seeing could be seen as the variations of adjacent universes, each one existing within the overall multiverse. 

Each potential future of humanity will be heavily influenced, and therefore co-created, dependent upon the choices of the people involved.  As spacetime progresses, each slightly different decision any person makes (from the infinite list of options available at any given time), will have its effect in shaping that universe. All of these different choices cause splits, and a new universe is then created in the multiverse, to progress alongside its predecessor, and all other adjacent universes. More decisions, more splits. Some choices are minor and inconsequential (or die out), and others have far greater effect on the world. Butterfly effect.

The Easter eggs can then be seen as the common elements that will persist across adjacent universes, because they split off from fairly recent, and therefore similar, predecessor universes. But because of the other mitigating forces at play, there will be other grander differences that will grow and shape the kind of world we get to live in.",False,blackmirror,"Instead of a shared universe, I propose adjacent universes in the multiverse"

**USS Callister**

- name of ship

- homage to star trek

**Ark Angel**

- Being watched over with or without you knowing.

- The word ""angel"" means messenger. An archangel then is a high messenger, a leader.

- The biblical Ark being a shelter against a great calamity. Arkangel was designed to shelter and coddle your kids, after all.


**Metalhead**

- refers to the dog machines

- refers to the shrapnel in the lead females head and face

- Also worth noting that Metalhead is most likely a reference to David Lynch's film Eraserhead, which was also in the horror genre and filmed in Black/ White.



**Hang The DJ**

- basically, it's a phrase used as an interjection when the radio station or club DJ is playing some trash.

- references The Smiths song playing at the end of the episode

- The song Panic by the Smiths is about rebellion, which is what the characters do.


**Crocodile**

- In response to Mia's crocodile tears through the episode. 

- referencing a crocodiles keen memory and ability to plan 


**The black museum**

- a tie in of the episodes of Black Mirror, aptly titled Black Museum. same font, same initials.

- The black museum is also a real museum in Scotland Yard, full of crime artefacts. It's essentially a super fancy evidence locker for close cases.

- The main attraction at Black Museum was literally a black man who (in the end) white supremacists would come to torture.

7635,1515164855,7obqpm,False,11,72,,False,blackmirror,Who else want to read this? Scene from Black Museum (S04E06)
7636,1515164575,7obpny,False,18,43,"One day, a child (aged around 10 or 11) wakes up, and looks around. We see he's in a large bedroom with very expensive looking furniture, a big tv, and a bunch of toys. He starts to do his morning routine when his parents walk in say they're ""taking him to the doctors"" for a checkup. He arrives, goes through the regular doctoral checkup stuff, and then the doctor asks to speak to the parents alone. They step out of the room, and the child is looking around, playing on a tablet or something, when the parents and doctor walk back in. The doctor says the child is going for a little trip, and then they escort him into a dark room. The child is told to watch a TV show (kind of like in Arkangel) as a nurse gets a needle-looking device ready. She's getting ready to inject it into the child, when the child looks and sees his parents leaving. He calls out to them, and starts struggling, and starts to cry, and the nurses have to hold him down, and then they inject him, he yelps, and the screen turns to black.

We then see the child again, slightly older (around 14-15), immediately wake up in a gasp, as if he just had a nightmare. He examines his surroundings, and while they aren't terrible, they are definitely a far cry from what he was used to. He's starting to panic when a woman opens the door and tells him to ""hurry up"" or he'll be late for school. He starts asking all the expected questions (tho who what where questions), and the woman acts like he's been her son her entire life. However, the teen starts to verbally fight her. She begs for him to go to school and if he does, she promises she'll explain everything. 

The child goes to school, but obviously isn't fitting in very well, and keeps running away and hiding in the bathroom during class, where he's crying. He sees some kids who he used to be friends with when he was younger, but they don't recognize him, and start to beat him up for crying in the bathroom.

He returns ""home"" and his ""mother"" (the mystery woman) notices his black eye, and tries to console him, but he shoves him off her forcefully and demands to know what's happening. They get into a fight with the woman constantly saying she won't say for his own good, until finally they both break down, and she tells him the situation.

Her name was Monica, and she used to be wealthy, married, and had a son she loved with all her heart. However, one day her husband skyrocketed in his career and divorced her, and took most of what she had as well, including her son. She fought for visitation rights, but her husband was filled with spite, and paid off the lawyers to limit her to monthly visits. There's a montage showing her visiting her son and watching him grow up, until one day on one of her monthly visits, she finds out that her ex-husband failed in his career and had been abusing her son, and one day he finally collapsed, and his father didn't take him to the emergency room so unfortunately he didn't survive. She decided she was going to ""adopt"" another child that she could raise.

Obviously our main character is really confused, because he already had parents and a home and called her ""fucking insane"", but she proves that she adopted him by showing him the papers, and he sees his parent's signature. He starts crying profusely, and runs out of the house. We see him running for a while, before he finally runs to his original home. He tries to use the biometrics to unlock the door, but they fail on him, and he increasingly starts to panic, but then he remembers a secret tunnel in his room that connected to their backyard, so he breaks in that way. He crashes a party his parents are hosting and everyone is shocked to see him. He tearfully demands to know what is going on, and his parents say they gave him away. When he asks why, they say he's defective. He's very confused, and his parents explain that he's not a real human, but rather a ""designer baby"" that they had picked out, since his ""mother"" couldn't have children. He's essentially an android. 

There are flashback scenes showing the parents originally at the ""Doctor's office"" from the beginning creating their designer baby, and its revealed it wasn't actually a doctor's office, but a laboratory for the rich to make these designer children. However, the doctor discovered a fatal flaw in his build, and its shown after he gets his ""shot"" from the beginning of the video, they were actually powering him down and removing his ""data"".

Then we see Monica at an ""adoption agency"", which is actually a group of Samaritans who ""purchase"" defective children from the different laboratories, and try to find them homes with caring people, rather than being deleted entirely. 

Our main character, devastated at this news, breaks down, while his now old parents literally throw him out of the house. Monica pulls up, runs out to him, and grabs him in a tight hug, and tells him that she never wanted him to find out this way. Then it cuts to them being at home, and our main protagonist is sitting in silence. Monica explains that he normally wouldn't have kept his memories, but a glitch in their system had him retain everything from his previous ""childhood"", and that she knows its hard for him, but that she's going to give him everything his parents never did. He asks ""well, what is that?"", and she says ""Love"". She stands there for a minute expecting a hug or something, but he remains motionless. She begins to walk out of the room, before she hears him say ""Thank you"", she turns around and smiles, and sticks her hand out. he stares for a moment, then reaches out, and touches her hand.

Admittedly, I am also biased towards seasons 1 and 2 because they have British actors in them, there's a distinctly British feel to the episodes, which is why I really liked episode 3 from Season 3 (the one that had Jerome Flynn in it who plays Bronn in GoT).

Also the episodes in seasons 1 and 2 have much darker endings in line with the overall tone of Black Mirror (a dark and satirical reflection of a future influenced by technology that isn't too far ahead from where we are now).

I know the last episode of season 3 has British actors in it, so I may watch that, but I feel like since Black Mirror's move to Netflix, the show has been watered down to cater to an American audience and culture that is based on the idea of hope and the American dream. Also a reason why British comedy is so different to American comedy, the former is based on the idea of pessimism.

For one thing, the box of teddy bears seems like a pretty stupid thing to risk 3 peoples' lives for, but after watching The Black Museum, could it be possible that they were trying to obtain vessels (similar to the monkey in Black Museum) to place the sick/dying child's consciousness into?

Another separate thought I had was about the choice of black and white for this particular episode. I mean it was a great stylistic choice, but could it also hint that perhaps this is not quite on the same level of reality as the rest of the series?

7663,1515152214,7oaocd,False,4,7,"So I cracked to whole logic of the episode.


At the very end we have the ""real"" characters seeing how the app determines a 99.8% of compatibility. This is an artistic license to make clear how the app works succesfully to find an ideal match, because any unsuccesful result would be arbitrary. And inside this succesful match, we get to see one of the simulations that goes through many cliches of the romance story genre that obviously work when you realize that they live in a very dystopian environment for people to work fully on their partner seeking quest (no jobs, no friends, no memories of the past, no pregnancies, no contact with the outside world) and it's all worth it because the system is meant to compare data and find the most suitable match out of it. Except... there is no such thing as data comparison and its all just an almost scripted scenario where they are meant to find out if they liked each other at first sight, share one night of intimacy and farewell, put up with rigged relationships (which mean to oversatisfy the woman and almost emasculate the man, right?), meet again, long for the first moment, etc until distance breaks them and they rebel to stay together. 


So this was one simulation, how did the other 999 play out differently? Do the NPC's change? Does the order differ, so they could meet after having a more seasoned experience of the system? Or is it all just the same exact scenario meant to find out how many times can it manipulate the simulated users to go from ""one night stand"" to ""rebellion""? My guess is the NPCs vary but the order doesn't differ, therefore it IS an scripted simulation that does manipulate according to a very fictional and idealistic scenario of love at first sight resulting in lifetime companionship. That scenario is the REAL system, the one the simulations can't scape because they hold no memories nor conscience of an outside world that can induce to long for things other than a partner. They never truly rebel because they're only expected to submit to the result of the system or hold onto their first true love (if it turns out to be it).



The truth is, in real life, where these two people are pushing their fingers on a screen to test their luck, there is no real proof their simulated love could endure the hashness and uncertainty that life can bring, either from past experiences or future ones. But who knows, right? This is why I think it's just as hopeful as it is dreadful, in the way that in the end we rely on fiction, *simulations*, to fuel in ourselves the idea of true love. Fictions as this episode itself.



This is my take on the episode after watching it once and thinking it through. Tell me what you think. If there's any inconsistency or details I might have missed out, I hope you'll let me know so we can discuss it.



PD: Some people, as i've been reading from comments on other threads, took the simulation as an actual experience inserted on the user's mind, making the 99.8% a sort of eventual proof that the couple has been ""matched"", but that's just too crazy in my opinion and lacks enough evidence in the story.

7764,1515115008,7o7kwq,False,22,0,"While I felt disappointed by this season I was not angry at them for taking things in a different direction.

People keep using the word ""dark"" but that does little to expand the conversation. I think dark is immeasurable. I would argue, however that season 3 had 3 episodes that while featured darker narratives also had optimistic or positive outcomes. Those 3 episodes would be Nosedive, San Junipero, and Hated in the Nation. And Season 4 on the other hand had 2 fairly positive or redeeming stories and 4 that varied quite abit on ""darkness."" For example I think while some might consider Arkangel a dull affair the mother did abort her daughters baby which I still regard as one of the most fucked up things to happen on the show. It's done so casually that I think there's a major disconnect between the action and the emotions of the viewer. When Sarah violently attacks her mom it only ""seems"" out of character but I think that's more because the gravity of the forced abortion was lost on viewers (albeit not to our fault but more likely on the fault of the writers.) Arkangel is also the first of two episodes this season that depict child murders. Maybe there's even a third if outright human genocide can be implied in Metalhead. Season 3 only has two suggestions of possible child murdering in Men Under Fire and Hated in the Nation. 

Tonally Season 3 does take the cake only because it is tonally more consistent in being dark versus Season 4 which is has at least 1 exceptionally positive episode. But personally I think I was far more disturbed by Black Museum than any other episode I've seen. This is why I think what constitutes dark is ultimately up to the viewer. 

I believe to say Season 3 is more tonally dark than season 4 is accurate at least based on distribution throughout the season. Tonality is felt instinctively and is not totally based on subject matter. It's why you can have dark comedies like In Bruges and come out saying that was pretty funny while also acknowledging some of the seriously disturbing aspects of it. So that is to also say while I believe Season 4 depicts more disturbing actions than season 4 is does not tonally convey that darkness through each episode. That is simply down to how the subject matter is portrayed and less on the subject matter itself. However, the portayal of subject matter can betray the instinctive reaction of the viewer. This is why I think Black Museum is the most disturbing episode because of it's rather gleeful or carefree tonality to things like sexual ecstasy in murder, being eternally locked in a stuffed monkey and relish in torture. 

TLDR:  While season 4 may be less consistently dark in it's tonality than Season 3 the severity of eaches' darkness is more subjective than objective.

PS. I realize this might be obvious to most but after seeing a few posts I thought we ought to use more clear language than ""worse"" or ""less dark"" when we discuss things as subjective as art.

Edit: Agreed that I was wrong to say that terminating a pre-fetal child was defacto murder. In my defense I was thinking of the mother and how she might've perceived that as such. 

Edit edit: I didn't realize, to my fault, that murder would be such a strong word in the context of abortion. Admittedly that was quite an oversight. It is also not my intention to raise to discussion what is the definition of murder when it comes to terminating a pregnancy. I do apologize to any I've offended with such a statement. I'm not altering my post, however, and I won't bother trying to convince anyone on the ""why"" of that either.",True,blackmirror,Another unsolicited opinion on Season 4

7790,1515109066,7o6y0g,False,29,37,"So I've watched the first four episodes of season 4, and absolutely loved Hang the DJ. The protagonists had fantastic chemistry, the episode was beautifully shot, and it was a lovely self-contained story.

The only part of the episode that bothered/confused me is the figure of ""99.8% success rate"". We see this number twice:

1. Within the simulation world, the protagonists tell each other that the system finds a perfect match with a 99.8% success rate.

2. At the episode climax, we learn that the app ran 1000 simulations using the copies of the two real life protagonists, and in 998 of them, they chose to run away together rather than go along with the ""perfect match"" assigned by the system. Thus, the app certifies the real life duo as ""99.8%"" compatible.

I see most commenters acting like the ""99.8%"" figure from the twist (#2) somehow *explains* the ""99.8%"" figure that was thrown out within the simulation (#1). But am I missing something, or is the equality of the two numbers simply coincidence?

The second ""99.8%"" figure is calculated *using* the results of the 1000 simulations (of which 99.8% were ""successes""). It wouldn't make any sense for that 99.8% figure to actually be used *within* the simulation that was used to eventually arrive at that statistic. Nor would it really make sense for them to be connected anyways... #2 is the level of compatibility of two people who meet at a bar, and #1 is the hypothetical success rate of the matchmaker in this simulation universe. 

Think of it this way. If the two people at the bar were a terrible match, and only 1% of the time do they end up together rather than the match chosen. Would the people in the simulation universe claim ""Don't worry, the matchmaker finds your perfect soulmate 1% of the time!"". The two numbers are unrelated, and their equality is just coincidence.

This is not a big deal, it's just something that confused me about the ending. Most commenters here seem to imply that the figures are connected (""so THAT'S what they meant by 99.8% success rate for a perfect match!""), when within the universe of the story, I don't think they're at all connected.

7806,1515100670,7o620g,False,15,16,"So usually I watch the episodes twice each before moving on to the next one to really sink it in. I watched Hang the DJ last night and again just right now and I don't get it.

First of all I have to say this is one of my favourite episodes ever. Black Mirror is usually very effective at fucking with my emotions but this time it beat my soul to death with a goddamn lead pipe. The  actors they got for Amy and Frank were absolutely lights out.

So at the end of the simulation, Amy decides she wants to see Frank one last time before leaving the system. Amy is making the active choice that she wants Frank - the critical part here I think is that she is making her own choice. She is the one deciding to fuck the system and that she doesn't care about the mistake Frank made.

When that happened, obviously I'm overjoyed that two people who were obviously amazing for one another managed to work through a heavy obstacle in their relationship and see the bigger picture. Right before the two of them arrive at that ladder, the two main lessons I've drawn are:

1. Someone's tiny moments of weakness aren't who they are no matter how important they might seem. We as shallow humans tend to irrationally attribute greater meaning to the negative than to the positive and it's thanks to the love that Frank and Amy shared that she managed to see that Frank is the guy for her, despite his mistake. Trust is important for relationships but so too is forgiveness. 

2. Technology can't be a replacement for human-to-human interaction. It didn't matter that Frank and Amy had been matched with someone else because they had realized that they were meant to be together and fuck societal pressure. We're not supposed to be relying on technology to replace relationships. We cultivate them ourselves with our own conscious choices and shared experiences. We shouldn't be letting the online version of ourselves replace what we can show each other. 

But then it turns out that it really is a simulation. Is the lesson now that we can find true love by applying an algorithm to the totality of our consciousnesses and let it run the data? Did the real Frank and Amy experience the simulation or was that an artistic adaptation of the program doing its thing? If they didn't, what was the point of showing us the ups and downs of their relationship? Why was Frank forced to endure a year of agony with that complete bitch? Why was Amy forced to swim through an ocean of shallow encounters before a second go with Frank? 

On the one hand, if they *did* experience the simulation, then we can say that Frank and Amy both got to experience their romantic lives if they just let their vices take hold. Frank would settle for someone he didn't truly feel for and Amy would just have a series of regretful one-night-stands. But then it takes away from them experiencing their first huge issue as a couple because they hadn't really even met yet. How do you deal with that in the real world?

On the other hand, if they *didn't* experience it, what was the point of showing it to us? 

Last question: does it mean anything that simulation-Frank was right about what the system actually was during their talk in the gazebo?",False,blackmirror,"Just finished watching ""Hang the DJ"". I don't understand what the episode was trying to say."
7807,1515100664,7o61zq,False,3,3,"(this may be a controversial opinion) 

My favorite part of Black Mirror is that each episode makes you think deeply about something different. Shut Up and Dance makes you think about the morality of vigilante justice. 15 Million Merits makes you think about how capitalism dilutes genuine emotions into a plastic, fake version of what it really is. White Christmas makes you debate the humanity of sentient code aaaaaahhhh shit so does half of season 4

We have the obvious: 

* White Christmas 

*  USS Callister 

* Black Museum 

And if we broaden our theme and look a little deeper into it: 

* San Junipero 

* Hang the DJ 

This concept really made me think, the first time it was brought up in Black Mirror. I spent a lot of time thinking about the implications of White Christmas and I still can’t come to an opinion. But now, I am so desensitized to the concept that it doesn’t really phase me anymore. By the time I got to Black Museum, it just felt like, “this has been done before”. 

This almost makes me want to go back to before the concept was introduced, when I could go in blind watching an episode and expect a moral debate that I never would have thought of otherwise. 

But I’ve already thought about this whole realm of “sentient code”. We all have. I don’t get why we need *more* episodes on the topic. I’d rather be introduced to a new realm of thought.

The world in ""15 million Merits"" isn't a distant future dystopia. It's a simulation, like the cookie in ""White Christmas"" and in other episodes. 

Nothing in that world makes sense. It's all enclosed in some large complex (like all the other cookie bubble universes). People prove their worth by going on bikes to ""power the whole thing"", but that is an obvious lie. There's no way that in that future society, stationary bikes would be the best source of electricity, and that they wouldn't need a more complex society with a variety of occupations. The point of the bike is to wear them down and make them desperate for something different. Furthermore, all the people who are new bikers being placed with no apparent memory of the past, yet they don't start as children. Bing's brother apparently died and left him 15 million merits, but how can anyone even die in this universe?

The point of the entire universe is the talent competition. They get everyone desperate enough to try anything, and they work on their talents and ideas and save up 15 million merits in order to get off the bike. They would rather be exploited for sex, or even that weird fat botherguts thing. Many of the bikers are probably NPCs. You can see it in the Ron Weasley looking guy, who has no personality and claps like a monkey, and you can see it in that piggish guy who rides the bike next to Bing's. Bing of course, is a ""real"" cookie, and probably so is Abby. 

I realized this after watching ""Hang the DJ"" because of the similarities between the worlds. Both exist in some parody of some futuristic society, in which people do some task that they don't understand for reasons that they don't quite grasp, living in a dreamlike state. Also, the fact that ""Wraith Babes"" is one of the pay per view options in ""Crocodile"". The ""Merits"" universe actually coexists with many of the others, and is being used to source entertainment for the stories that take place at the same time period as ""Crocodile"". Also, as others have mentioned on this subreddit, Mia, the architect from Crocodile was designing a ""community"" that looked strangely like the one from ""Merits"". She isn't designing real world communities, but she's an architect for virtual universes, reminiscent of Ariadne from ""Inception"".

A couple days ago they discovered a man had murdered a girl who'd been missing for over two years. Kinda like the story from Black Museum, except that there's pretty solid evidence this guy did it.

I'm not the only one apparently, as people have been waiting outside his sessions to scream things at him as he goes in/out, there's reports that even the inmates at his prison have been harassing him, all things i think he deserves and i mean as long as no one kills anyone else all is fair i guess. But they're going as far as spaying his house with death treats, a house where other people who probably didn't participate in the murder still live, and even trying to find out his daughter's social media so they can harass her too (a girl who apparently is like eight years old).

But then, there's precedent.

The show has elocuted in the past the difference between a personality and data aggregated about a personality. In Be Right Back, we see this played out to sad detail, and it speaks to something that we encounter in our daily lives: accumulated data has a hard time truly representing a person. Through all the data aggregated through all those internet-connected devices that listen to what you're saying and tracking where you are, along with everything you post about yourself, a general pattern emerges about you; that slosh, tacked together with stuff accumulated from your social circles, might resemble you as a poor facsimile, but that's all it ever is. Personality isn't a static concept that can be mapped out like a generic variable over time: it changes at the whim of no one for reasons sometimes not always known.

With the two protagonists, we only know the true thems for a few seconds, but the differences are apparent almost immediately: how they dress is the starkest contrast. In the simulations, they dress like Mormons or retail shop poster models; in real life, Amy has a nose ring and a denim jacket, while Frank has a stylized t-shirt. There's even a moment of uncertainty between the two of them while they're smiling at each other with neither certain who makes the first move; in the story, though a bit awkward, they were still eager.

Maybe this contrast in the episode exists on purpose, and why it's 99.8% rather than 100%: because even the most accurate computer simulation can't account for personality, as much as some Silicon Valley entrepreneurs would attest to the opposite. They can take static variable input and introduce situations that alter those variables outcomes, but given those limitations, there are only so many outcomes that can happen before consistency emerges.

It's why I think that the ending to Hang the DJ is ambiguous (or, really, hopeful) rather than a more straightforward happy ending a la San Junipero- we've seen their digital avatars interact, not them. Their avatars have no stated history or desires (at least in the episode, they didn't speak about their pasts or where they were from or what they wanted to do), and though whatever accumulated data would say that Frank and Amy would get on, there's no way to tell until they get to talking.

**San Junipero** - good Episode but I don't understand why it is looked upon so highly, it doesn't even make it into my Top 10. 

**The Entire History Of You** ( to some extent) - I actually really like this episode, I would put it somewhere around 7th to 9th in my episode rankings but I have seen it many times as people's personal favourite.

**Black Museum** - I thought this episode was trying way too hard to fit all of the references in which made it feel forced, the whole episode felt rushed due to the mini-stories not being fleshed out over a one hour period and overall the whole episode just felt like they were trying to get to the ""main attraction"" as soon as possible but they had to stretch out the episode with some other stories and this is what they managed to come up with. At some parts the writing felt ultra lazy and Solo Haynes's character was written as a caricature and as a plot device not as a believable human being. His seemingly descent into madness in the last five minutes was totally unrealistic and the overall message of the episode was hypocritical at best. Don't forget about the cheesy ending where we find out that Nish had her mother in her head the whole time and this just adds up to possibly my least favourite Black Mirror Episode ever.

Underrated: 

**Playtest** - I thought this was a fantastic episode, full of unexpected twists that actually made you think about the ending. Also, great performance from the actor who played Cooper.

**Hated In The Nation** - I am aware that we on this sub are not the only BM fans in existence, however I have seen most people turn on Hated In The Nation in the last half a year or so. Maybe it doesn't hold up as well on a rewatch, I will give you that but seeing this episode for the first time was awesome and I used to have it in my Top 3.

**The Waldo Moment** - This is just the most underrated BM episode ever, no question about it. I don't have it very high on my episode rankings list either but I feel like that sometimes the amount that the fans shit on this episode is a bit too much. I think this is an enjoyable and relatable episode on a rewatch, so let's hope it's reputation can change a bit in the future.

That the show Hot Shots actually DOES exist, we know it does because the reference in Crocodile about one of the hosts being outted as a guest at the hotel..And also Wraith Babes as a show you can rent at the hotel. So 15 Million Merits maybe did NOT actually happen, but it exists in the form of a graphic novel based on the hit reality show Hot Shots.

7911,1515059543,7o202r,False,5,8,"Okay, it's pretty late, and this is a bit long, so read at your own risk.

After watching a couple episodes I started realizing that there are some very deliberate music choices in this season, so after taking a look at the ol' TuneFind page I notice that nearly every episode has very purposeful music choices. Some of it is pretty obvious and shallow, but others might have a deeper meaning than meets the eye (or I could just be over-thinking all this).

USS Calister doesn't really feature and licensed music so I'll skip over that episode.

Arkangel features a song called ""I'm a mother"" by The Pretenders, which is probably one of the more transparent song choices in the season, as it is just about the sacrifices a mother makes for her child. Later, ""Bang Bang There Goes My Pistol"" plays, which really just fits thematically, also foreshadowing the end where the daughter lets loose and attacks her mother, letting her proverbial pistol go.

Crocodile has a bunch of interesting music choices in it, starting right away with Goldfrapp's ""Strict Machine"", which was the first song I immediately recognized in the season, and gave me the idea to make this post. It doesn't necessarily fit the episode it was featured in, but the lyrics do really fit in with the concepts explored in Black Mirror. ""I get high on a buzz // Then a rush when I'm plugged in you,"" even tying in sex into the interactions between people and machines. Later, Irma Thomas' ""Anyone Who Knows What Love Is"" is used to jog people's memories of the incident, but really seems to be speaking ironically from the protagonist's perspective. My interpretation is that the episode is showing that people don't really do much out of love, at least not compared with what they will do for self-preservation. This is further supported by the next song, which was sung by the children sing in the school play near the end, You give a Little Love by Paul Williams. With lyrics like ""We could have been anything that we wanted to be \\ Yes, that decision was ours \\ It's been decided \\ We're weaker divided"" the song almost gloats at the protagonist for making the decisions in the interest of self-preservation and selfishness rather than out of love, or friendship, but by now the cops know she is a murderer, ""it's been decided.""

Over the end credits of Hang the DJ we hear ""Panic"" by The Smiths, the lyrics of which, the episode was named after. If you wanted to extrapolate more meaning out of this song choice, you might be able to relate the phrase ""Hang the DJ,"" or blaming the DJ for playing music that doesn't match the tone of the room to blaming ""The System"" in the episode for poorly interpreting the romantic desires of the protagonists. If you wanted to go even more tin foil hat, you could say that since this song came out shortly after Chernobyl, it is foreshadowing Metalhead, and contributing to my theory that it did indeed take place after a nuclear holocaust.

Metalhead is probably my favorite episode in terms of the music featured on it, but that's mostly because of the inclusion of Pendrecki's ""Threnody for the Victim's of Hiroshima"" (as well as snippets of Pendrecki's other works) which was also featured in Twin Peaks, The Shining, and Children of Men. All of those media use this piece to create an extreme sense of uneasiness and fear, and Metalhead is no exception, even going as far as using the percussive sections of the piece to sound like sound effects that tie into the visuals (rewatch the scene where she is climbing the tree as an example). Before, I mentioned that I have a theory that this episode takes places after a nuclear holocaust, and featuring this piece of music is really a big clue that maybe that is true. Coupling that with some visual evidence, and someone might be able to make a good case for the theory, but that's not what I'm here to talk about. ""Golden Brown"" by the Stranglers is also featured in this episode when the protagonist blasts this song out of the car to attract the ""dog."" The lyrics of this song tell of lying down, and letting your mind run with ""no need to fight"". A cruel contrast, to the scene this song was featured in, where lying down and giving up isn't what she intends on doing in the scene, but foreshadows that she ends up doing that in the end. In reality the song is about Heroine, but I don't really have a theory to tie that into the episode (unless the bear at the end of the episode was really filled with heroine). Something else worth noting about this song is the strange tuning and time signature at the beginning of the song. Again, this is a stretch, but the ""dog"" loses a leg, leaving it with three legs, and it runs with sort of a weird rhythm, which reminded my of the '3 bars of 3 and a bar of 4' time signature at the beginning of the song.

Finally, we have Black Museum. ""(There's) Always Something There to Remind Me"" by Dionne Warwick which plays while the protagonist is in her car.

There was a bit I liked where he leaves the [control unit] while the robot is watching her while she’s up in the tree and he goes and gives his kids a bath. But it felt a bit weird and too on-the-nose.""

When I read this, I first imagined this was like military drone strikes using the dogs, a war scenario.

But then I thought of this theory: there are people controlling them, and those people are playing a video game essentially where they actually kill people. Basically, I'm thinking about (the real thing of) internet hunting: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_hunting , just with people rather than other animals (well, they killed the pigs of course, too). I think this fits in with the classism talk (the pig discussion); people with means are (legally?) able to control these robots and kill for sport. So, with this theory, the question I'm left with is, why are they allowed to? Is their country at war with Britain? Is it not legal but it's just happening anyway (like super-rich people eating endangered species in underground restaurants in NYC)?

I'm not attached to this theory. It's just something I thought of that I haven't seen elsewhere yet. (I'm sure some of you clever watchers have thought of it too, though.)

Also could see it being more of an Ender's Game sort of scenario [Spoiler Alert](/s ""where the people doing it think they're just playing a game and don't realize they're killing real people. In this scenario, maybe it is a war thing, and so it would be a way to get civilians to do the killing without realizing."") (just an Ender's Game spoiler there.)

7922,1515054194,7o1nqw,False,9,1,"After watching Hang the DJ i feel like they had a great episode but settled for good. 

At the most pivotal point of episode - when they are plotting the escape and the guards come. The guards are put on pause and the next scene they are climbing the wall and the matrix collapses. It was sloppy and they let gold slip right through their fingers. 

The guards should have been “real”. They needed to add 20 minutes of escape. 20 minutes of heart racing, emotional, I don’t know if these two are making it out thriller. 

I wanted to see those two fight tooth and nail to get out of the simulation. I wanted to see the love, where he has to make sacrifices for her. I wanted to see them run through a forest, climb a mountain... “ain't no mountain high,
Ain't no valley low, ain't no river wide enough” you get what I’m saying. 

I wanted to be on the edge of my seat thinking these two are about to die for the little love that was only suppose to last a few hours. I wanted to see him carry her on the last leg of the escape, to his dying breath, make it through a white door located at the wall and THEN realize it was only a simulation and in essence he was willing to die for her and vice versa.

7926,1515052271,7o1iz2,False,22,8,"Which is better?

For me, White Christmas is far superior as not only does it have relatable and likeable characters who we spend the majority of the episode with but it also tackles themes that were (at that point) previously unexplored by Black Mirror, these being the concept of blocking and Cookies.

Joe Potter was such a sympathetic character despite the crime he did because you get to see what he sees, feel what he feels - it is shown not told, and that’s what makes the final snowglobe montage so harrowing...

Black Museum on the other hand was three mostly detached stories which only linked together because of technology as opposed to characters. 
Doctor Pain and Monkey Loves You were both extremely interesting but they were very short - I feel those concepts could have been explored much more in standalone episodes as opposed to a triple whammy one.

The finale of the episode with Nish confronting Mr Haynes had no emotional impact because we didn’t know the character nor her dad, the whole crime/aftermath/emotion was told to us not shown. The dialogue felt very hammy too, and that ending just screamed “yeah badass” as opposed to “wow that’s interesting” like usual.
You can argue that Brooker was changing things up in this episode but if if ain’t broke, don’t fix it.",False,blackmirror,White Christmas v Black Museum

(No talk or hope of escaping from survivors, the wealthy couple killing themselves after a news broadcast)  You might say maybe there are bigger deadlier robots, but why not mention them at least in passing, or better yet make this episode about them. 

And I was kind of on board with this business until we see that this thing can't climb trees or get over walls. That really just kind of killed it for me. The greatest militaries on earth couldn't just put some tape over a USB port and stand on top of a wall and shoot all these things dead with their rifles vs these thing's short range shotguns? 

They couldn't get inside of a tank, or an APC and just like machine gun these things down? 

I know not very black mirror needs a twist, but I really expected one for this to make it make sense that the military hadn't just wiped these out already. I was thinking this is either a Running Man style game show to give surgery to their sick kids, or a military weapons test, or a genocide against drug addicts. Just something. 

It really feels like they made such a dumb antagonist as a writing crutch to make it possible for the chase scenes to work. If it had been something legitimately scary to humanity like the spooky robot bees or flying drones it would be even sillier that she isn't just murdered instantly. 

but as it stands this was probably the episode of black mirror I was most disappointed with, and I even enjoyed the chases, I thought it was suspenseful and well shot but the fact that these things look like Sharper Image toys, have to resort to cutlery to be murderous when they lose their gun or run out of ammo, can't climb walls, and require a fucking jack to do anything (Apple users sit home safe and smug) just makes them such silly enemies.

&gt;Mia Kills Noni. Mia finds Noni's address through Noni's gps. Mia kills Noni's husband. Mia notices that Noni has a child. Mia reaches her breaking point, unable to bring herself to murder a child to hide her crimes. Distraught, Mia returns home and commits suicide as she believes that the child's memories will lead to her arrest. The police arrive at the scene and hook the boy into a recaller only to learn that he is blind. The police are out of leads since no one knew who Noni was investigating. The murders go unsolved. Mia's husband and child never know why Mia killed herself during her child's school play. Everyone is sad. The end.

.

In the version of the story we got, however, the story goes like this:

&gt;Mia Kills Noni. Mia finds Noni's address through Noni's gps. Mia kills Noni's husband. Mia notices that Noni has a child. *Mia kills Noni's son*. Mia, now psychologically broken, attends her son's school play. The police arrive at the scene ***almost immediately after the murders.*** The police, for no reason other than to prove to us how dark and edgy the show is, mention that the child was blind. The police ***hook up a guinea pig to the recaller.*** The guinea pig's memories allow them to identify the murderer. The police immediately know where Mia's son's school is, and they arrive ***before the play is over*** to arrest Mia. Mia is arrested. Everyone is sad. The end.

Seriously though, best police in the history of the world apparently. They somehow knew that a murder took place, got to the scene within an hour of the crime despite having no way of knowing anything was wrong, used the recaller on the stupid fucking guinea pig, identified the suspect, and dispatched officers to her ***son's goddamn school because apparently everyone in the world knew she had a kid who was in a school play that evening,*** and immediately arrest her. No. Fucking ***NO.***

.

*This next paragraph is just me angrily ranting about the guinea pig, feel free to skip it.*

Instead of this, she gets done in by a ***fucking guinea pig***. I'm so upset about that goddamned guinea pig. Not only because it makes the ending narratively unsatisfying, but it is decidedly un-BlackMirror-y. To elaborate on why this is bullshit: the room she was 'seen' in was dark, even if the guinea pig had the visual acuity of a person it is unlikely that it would have gotten a good look at her face. Additionally, they specifically mention that memories can only be recalled if associated with strong emotions (or association with stimuli like the song that was playing and the smell of the pub down the street). A recaller couldn't even be used to help a person remember where they left their keys, yet we're supposed to believe that this guinea pig had a strong emotional reaction to an event it has no ability to understand (bullshit), was able to give a perfect recall of it despite not being human and having a brain the size of a grape (bullshit), and then, and this is the part that pisses me off the most, the police arrested a woman based *solely* off of the fucking testimony of a small rodent, and they arrested her before Mia's kid's play was even over (BULLSHIT). Seriously, did she call the cops herself? How the FUCK did the police get there so fast?! 

.

##The writing in this episode is indicative, I think, of the problem with this season of Black Mirror. Black Mirror as a whole endeavors to create a single continuous universe that feels realistic. It does this through references (like in Black Museum) and through narrative through lines and technology. However, these callbacks back the writers into a corner, leading to contradictions, fucked up timelines, and straight up missing plot details. For example; what the fuck happened to Zed Eyes? They, or at least very very similar technology, were in a lot of episodes, but they've just never been mentioned again despite literally everyone having them in White Christmas (which is very clearly before Black Museum, but no one seems to have them anymore).

.

This is bad writing. Black Mirror is a series meant to feel uncomfortably visceral and real, and to nullify the immersion of the viewer in order to be edgy is a sin. Cheap jumpscares ruined mainstream horror films, we must not allow the same to be done to Black Mirror. The writing in the first 3 seasons (in my personal, subjective, opinion) is better than this. I hope Black Mirror gets a 5th season that learns from mistakes like this one.

.

At some point the writing changed from unique Twilight Zone style stories about technology-- fueled by an ethically destitute society-- going awry, to edgy /r/nosleep fanfictions thinly veiled as Black Mirror episodes.

#--------Rant End--------

TL;DR- the police mentioning that the kid was blind serves only to gut punch the audience and is equivalent to a shitty fourth wall break. It adds nothing to the narrative, and completely took me out of the experience because it reminded me that people wrote this story, instead of feeling like a story that actually happened.

I want to thank everyone for the lively posting on that post, I was really looking discussion on the ethics and morals of cookies and how they were regarded in society.  

It was super awesome to watch Black Museum and watch exactly how those cookies were developed and get a brief glimpse into how society and law dealt with their rights.  It answered most of the questions I had and I personally could have watched like an 8 hour documentary about them.

I thought it was super cool they showed the DNA machine from Callister in the museum thus showing how meth damon not only was in the same universe but came before the museum in time frame, thus proving my point in a lot of my devil's advocate questions that when damon was doing all his sadistic sims plays there was a good chance that at that early point in society cookies were still seen as just code, not sentient, entertainment and having no rights.

So it's really possible that as much as meth damon was  a creepy loner luser kinda guy that he still wasn't doing anything socially unacceptable other being a gamer.   

But then one could easily look at it as in our history it was seen as socially acceptable and not negative to mistreat and be violent to minorities and now we look back on it and say ""wow, how did they not see what they were doing was wrong"", one could say the same thing with how they used to treat cookies.",False,blackmirror,Just watched Black Museum and it answered all my questions about Callister

Apologies if I put too much trust in Reddit search. Someone I am close with deals with contraceptives on a daily basis, and blew a gasket during that scene in Arkangel, and encouraged me to post.

It is incorrect to say that ""termination"" of the daughter's pregnancy could come about via EC products like Plan B One-Step, Take Action or ella, and disingenuous to claim so while flashing an ""Emergency Contraception"" generic box in closeup shots. 

There are an infinity of 'what if's' that viewers may apply to the scenes: what if the notification off-screen was actually for implantation, or a later phase of gestation? What if the sensors can only pick up a 4wk-old embryo, or a 8wk-old fetuses, and thus the alert was somehow even more of a surprise? What if EC is a different type of medication inside the world of Black Mirror than IRL, like a supertech nano abortion pill of some kind? Is the abortion pill over the counter in-universe??

To these my question in response is, why use a literal, identifiable stand-in for EC, if EC wasn't what was intended for the plot? The plot requires nothing else than existing EC technology to arrive at the theme of betrayal of bodily autonomy, but if ""terminate the pregnancy"" was the intended plot, then why depict EC?

Obviously, I can ascribe no malice and this was simply a mistake in the script. It's also largely irrelevant to the story, so I can forgive Charlie B for using a punchy loaded word like ""terminate"" for something that is not depicted as a pregnancy (with no compelling reason to make it one). The fact remains that ""terminate"" is only a relevant term after a fertilized egg has implanted into the uterine wall, and not before. Far-right publications seek any angle/event to incorrectly claim otherwise, even if it will cause only 1 misinformed youngling out of 999 to flip.

Emergency Contraception is harmless, a utopian technology in itself, and it really does not serve to 'punch it up', for those single-digit-% (hopefully) of viewers who will read scandal, or worse yet, become misinformed, from the scenes. I am confident the viewership can handle it, and I liked the episode pretty well otherwise.

I believe the episode would’ve been far more interesting if they’d continued with the themes of unnecessary censorship brought up by the content filter. I was most interested in the scene where the therapist showed Sarah the drawing of two men fighting and she could not comprehend their negative emotions because the content filter had not allowed her to acclimate to anything deemed “too stressful or graphic.” 

I would’ve continued with this theme, maybe having the grandfather fall victim to a crime on the street and have Sarah be unable to help because she can’t understand that he’s hurt or in danger.

8026,1515021237,7nyltj,False,3,0,"So first, lemme remind you guys that these are opinions. Everybody likes and hates different BM episodes for different reason. Some people seem to take it personal when you dont agree. So from worst to best, here's all 19 ranked by me. 

*worst to best* 

These first 3 are low tier. I don't hate any BM episode but these are the ones that didnt click at all with me and I have zero interest to watch again. 

• Fifteen Million Merits. This is just... too much for me really. Everything about it is so *obnoxious and over the top.* this is the ONLY episode of the show I havent watched twice. Hell I barely even made it through the first time. I respect and like the message but it felt way too drawn out and over the top for me. 

• Nosedive. Just like 15mm, i barely made it through a first watch. I watched it later and second time and liked it quiet a bit more though. Acting, theme and premise were great but the main character annoyed the shit out of me. I cannot place my finger on why, but it didn't feel much like a BM episode. 

•ArkAngel. This episode was good but seemed like it ended way too early. Feel like there should have been more to the story. Plus, the show acting like Sarah was 15 distracted me from the whole episode. Shes 21 irl but looks WAY older than 15. 


Mid- low tier. These episodes arent the worst of the batch, and while I choose to not rewatch them much, i dont mind sitting through a rewatch. These are episodes I simply just like, not love. 

•The National Anthem. This episode is probably, imo, the biggest outlier to the show. The use of tech is so little and it didn't really have a plot twist. Sure, a guy fucking a pig is a twist but that idea was brought up, like 5 mimutes into the episode and the whole episode revolved around that. It's disturbing as fuck but not the Black Mirror type of disturbing. 

•Metalhead. this one is weird for me because i loved it and was completely glued to my screen... but the lack of plot hurts. It's a great episode of tv, but not a great episode of Black Mirror. Also, it left a *ton* of open questions. Open questions arent a horrible thing, but theres so many in this episode that it kinda drives me crazy to think about. 

• The waldo Moment. imo, the most underrated episode of Black Mirror. It is consistently referred to as the worst and i think it was decent, with an amazing final 10 minutes. So much emotion and the last scene where we see Waldo has pretty much taken over while jaime is now homeless was heartbreaking. 

• Hated In the Nation. This episode was really good and fucked up on my first watch, but on my second watch I just wanted it to end. Good episode with many disturbing themes and scenes but... overall it just falls kinda flat. 


Mid tier. These episodes are obviously the ones that aren't *great* but not *bad*. I wouldnt say I love them, but i definitely like them alot. 

• Men against Fire. This, like Waldo, is underrated. Alot of criticism for this episode is that the plot and twist were predictable. While I agree to an extent... I think that's the point. This episode wasnt supposed to be a big mindfucky episode. It was supposed to be disturbing throughout, with deep and scary themes. 

• Black Museum. This episode bombed at the end. Three disturbing  intriguing and exciting parts of the story that led up to a generic and simple ending. If it had ended a little smarter, it would be a top tier episode. 

• Crocodile. This episode has all the components of what makes BM great... but kinda fell flat to me. I wish something deeper happened, like they had found out that the biker commited suicide by dropping in front of their car, making all the killing useless. I'm not sure why, this episode was good and should have been great, but just wasnt great. 


Mid- top tier. These are episodes I love. I have seen them multiple times and are all great episodes, but arent in top tier simply because theres episodes I like more. 

•The Entire History of You. This episode is the one that I liked WAY more on my rewatch. Everything about Kim's descent to madness and the big twist at the end (his kid possibly not being his) was all around well acted, directed, written, etc. Liam is such a gray character which makes the episode one of those that make you really think. 

•San Junipero. This, imo, is the most overrated episode of BM, even though I like it. I think its the most overrated because it is so accessible to so many different kinds of audiences. Furthermore, I have seen it 5 or 6 times and still love it. Something that Charlie really nailed was leaving the ending as a ""is it happy, or dark?"" Type of ending. Nosedive also did this but not as great as San Juni. 

•White bear. Oh man, this episode fucked me from the get go. The people with cameras was tripping me hardcore, and the twist really threw me for a loop. 

•Playtest. This episode is pretty controversial because people think there were too many twists. I don't think so. Blew my mind AND depressed me. The second half is incredible, but i feel like it was way too much nonsense in the first half. The parts BEFORE the main character got his chip in were excessively long and pulls the episode down from top tier. 

Top tier. Simply the best of the best. 

•USS Callister. This episode left me shooketh because i was really expecting to dislike it. I'm not a fan at all of that kind of spacey stuff, and I had a weird vibe about the episode. But it was funny, dramatic, twisted and satisfying. I LOVED Walton. My only riff with the episode is that I wish there was a sense of doom for our characters at the end. I'm part of the 'robert was obviously a sick psycho and deserved to die' group but our main characters were kinda left in a happy place. I think the episode was so heroic feeling and epic that it would've been perfect black mirror fashion to end our main characters in a terrible place. 

•Shut Up and Dance. This episode, like the national anthem, isnt too tech heavy. Obviously the episode revolved around hacking, but other than that we didnt really see any technology being used. And it was nice. The acting by the main character was so great and convincing. The story was enthralling, exciting and straight to the point. Not to mention the final plot twist. Makes you REALLY think and leaves for great rewatches. 

• Hang The DJ. I have said before that my biggest issue with season 4 is that it didn't go as dark as it should, so me putting this #3 is kinda odd. But, i think one light episode a season is good. The other episodes were dark, but not as fully dark as they should have been. If that makes sense. Enough about that though. Hang the DJ was well done, greatly acted and such a refreshing episode. I didnt see the simulation thing coming at all, so even though it is the lightest episode yet, it is still very much black mirror. The best part about this episode is that I was expecting to hate it. I predicted, before s4 aired, how i would rank the episodes and i got Black Museum &gt; croc &gt; arkangel&gt; callister &gt; Metalhead &gt; DJ. boy was I wrong. 

• Be Right Back. This episode strikes me particularly because i would react *exactly* how martha did. I have such a fear of losing my girlfriend ( i get anxious when she's sick, driving alone, doesnt text me for a good part of the day etc.) so this episode really connected with me on a personal episode. The part where martha tries to get Ashbot to jump off the cliff but ends up just screaming is my favorite Black Mirror scene. Certainly helps that I love Hayley and Dohmnall as well. 

• White Christmas. Do I need to really even explain this. White Christmas is number one because the three sections are all fantastic (the last one with the kid and grandpa was the best) and lead to an unexpected, but brilliant ending. So heartbreaking. After this episode I paced around my room literally taking to myself trying to make sense of this. Jon Hamm and the other guy KILLED it. I have seen this episode around 10 times, and each time im glued to the screen. They tried to replicate this success with Black Museum, but no episode with *ever* like up to White Christmas. BM could go for 10 seasons and I'm positive no episode will ever affect me like White Christmas did.",False,blackmirror,Now that I have seen all S4 episodes twice and given them a little time to think about and digest... I made a new episode fanking. Thought I would share and see if anyone wants to discuss.

But keep in mind this is just a matter of an opinion. **Not to say I didn't like season 4, because I did enjoy it greatly. But in some areas I enjoyed the last few seasons more**

*Mainly for a few reasons:*

---

**Not any big ""Mind fuck plot twists""**
The only big plot twist would be Hang The DJ and Black Museum. But even then, it wasn't anything mind-blowing. Nothing left me as fucked up as, let's say, Shut Up and Dance did. And whilst *always* having a plot twist might ruin the fun a bit, it is always fun to have one big plot twist once in a while. 

**No new themes explored**
This is probably the biggest problem from this season. It was way too much focus on consciousness and brain implants. I don't think I can mention even one other episode that doesn't feature it except Metalhead. And in my opinion, this episode was just pure awful. It was interesting to follow, but way too much lacking on backstory and message of the episode. Episodes from S3,2,1 would make us question our reality, how we empathize for people, how we rate people and live our lives. Too much on one-theme this season. I would love to have an episode on maybe, prostitution, self-driving cars, child engineering or etc. 

**Way too many easter eggs**
Whilst it is fun with easter eggs, they just way outdid it this season. I think easter eggs should be something you need to search for, not something that gets splatted on your face repeatedly. Feels like they did this to draw even more attention to the show. 

**Should been more dark episodes**
Whilst some would argue USS Callister, Black Museum and Crocodile didn't have a happy ending. Some would argue against. But personally it felt more like a ""San Junipero"" ending. Happy ending, but yet dark. What others might refer to as a ""bittersweet ending""

**Too ""Americanized""**
I would love more places to be explored. What I loved about season 1 and 2 especially is the atmosphere. And I think UK is unbelievable good at making dark episodes. Hence why season 3 was my favorite, it was a mix of both this dark, UK-feeling episodes (Shut Up and Dance and Hated In the Nation) whilst the rest being a bit more lighthearted.

There you go, that's my thoughts on this season. Would love to hear your guys opinions. 

In afterhand I apologize for my lack of English skills. **What did you all guys think of this season of Black Mirror?** ",True,blackmirror,Season 4 was a letdown if you ask me. What did you think?

8046,1515015169,7nxwev,False,10,2,"On a whim, I rewatched season 3's episode ""Playtest"" the other night.  You know, the one where the guy signs up to test a video game and ends up in a haunted mansion, or so it all seems.

My question is this: does anyone else remember a different sequence of events near the end?  I remember the virtual Sonya stabbing the protagonist before the real Sonya shows up and tries to convince him to leave because the company actually IS evil.

But this is not the ending.  Instead, the protagonist must go upstairs and enter a room so the simulation can be turned off.  Of course, this is prior to the twist in which we learn what's really going on.

Does anyone else remember the main character being convinced to go outside by the real Sonya?

(In any case, a really cool concept would be to make different endings, and for the first month or so viewers of Black Mirror see one ending, while for the rest of the year audiences see a different one.

1. **Fifteen Million Merits (4.92)** - Episode that got me into the series so a bit of favoritism.

3. **Playtest (4.77)** - As a big horror fan, this was a true nightmare.
4. **USS Callister (4.69)** - The acting and universe created in one hour is better than most movies. 
5. **Metalhead (4.50)** - Unpopular opinion but I adored the mystery, artistry, and horror. 
6. **Nosedive (4.47)** - Closest viewpoint into what our society could become tomorrow. 
7. **White Christmas (4.39)** - Jon Hamm and multiple twists, what more could you ask for. 
8. **Hang the DJ (4.25)** - There is just something so heartwarming about this one. 
9. **Black Museum (4.10)** - Has such a powerful ending. Also, monkey loves you. 
10. **Be Right Back (4.03)** - Exactly what I would do if I lost my significant other. 
11. **Shut Up and Dance (3.90)** - Fun ride and a great twist.
12. **Hated in the Nation (3.78)** - Scary with a good mystery. Lower due to the fact it was a bit lengthy. 
13. **Crocodile (3.56)** - Felt that it dragged a bit and was somewhat predictable. Still, great writing.
14. **San Junipero (3.40)** - Great story, but I'm not sure if I would have chose that ending. 
15. **The Entire History of You (3.33)** - Predictable unfortunately. The tech is so intriguing nonetheless. 
16. **The National Anthem (3.20)** - Can't really recommend this one is the only real issue! Amazing twist.
17. **Men Against Fire (3.02)** - Fun ride, but entirely too predictable. Orgasmic rewards were interesting.
18. **Arkangel (2.88)** - The episode stayed moving, but felt like it could have had more story to it. 
19. **The Waldo Moment (2.56)** - Funny at times, but nothing about the political message pulled me.

""He would not forget about the patch"" Yea he would, he did twice when giving introductions to his employees.
About the patching thing, Daly is connected to the real life and to the internet, cause he can get pizza notifications, idk how most of this works but as he is the development boss, the patch might apply from his phone thing. He simply forgot it, but someone with more knowledge can probably correct me.

It has several equal-sized rooms, including simple, rectangle beds and yellow walls all around. There has been a theory that she is the architect of the structure we see in ""Fifteen Million Merits."" 

The biggest evidence of this is the scene where she speaks at the forum. The host says ""Someone who has risen to become one of the most innovative architects of her generation. Not just an architect of buildings, but of communities."" Throughout this scene, an instrumental cover of ""Anyone Who Knows What Love Is"" plays. It's also interesting that she's standing in a very modern building, with windows that are split into equal rectangles, almost resembling a hive. The poster next to her states, ""Forum: Future Living,"" and features a design of a landscape repeated in identical rectangles. The song, in addition to Wraith Babes appearance in the hotel, and the receptionist mentioning one of Hot Shots' judges, means that Mia may have implemented these things into integrated entertainment in her self-sufficient, bunker-like community. 

Now, in ""Black Museum,"" we see the bloody bathtub Mia murdered Shazia's husband Anan in. This shows that, indeed, the police was able to recall Mia's crime from the guinea pig and thus arrest her. The bathtub is featured in the museum as a piece of evidence from a famous crime. 

Now, we know the society in Black Mirror is brutal, and cares little for the quality of life of its ""less well off"" citizens. In ""Men Against Fire,"" we see the awful conditions the soldier's house is in, but he sees it as a beautiful suburban home. If Mia designed a futuristic community intended to be Utopian and self-sufficient, it's entirely possible that, following her arrest and subsequent infamy, Black Mirror's society adopted her Utopian design into a dystopian complex. Maybe this is adopted as a way to deal with overpopulation, shipping the lower class there so the rich can enjoy the Earth. Or maybe it's just a bunker of sorts in the event of the Earth becoming uninhabitable.

**Note2:**[I'm not a black mirror expert, but in a show meant to raise discussion, feel free to tell me why everything i say is complete bollocks]
....With that out the way, onto the post

It seems that in the recent series of the show, the call backs and easter eggs in the show have become more repeated motifs and concepts, bringing back the same themes and technologies of past episodes. This at least alludes to a more connected universe, and if not, it could at least be assumed people would react similarly to the same concepts as they did in past episodes.

Here is where my issue arose whilst watching USS Callister. This episode felt, at the very least, less subtle in its callbacks making it feel more connected to me as a viewer, whether or not this was intended by the writers. Given that DNA doesn't have memories, either making that part of the episode make no sense, or allows the viewer to compare them to the cookies in white christmas....

Okay, so now we're comparing them to cookies, my first thought was then ""didn't it make it pretty clear in white christmas that cookies aren't treated like people in this universe?"". Back then, it felt like the show displayed to the viewer how the characters reacted to the technology, then allowed them to make their own opinions on the subject. In USS Callister instead, only the saturday cartoon villain that they turned Daly into seemed to act like the past characters. It then has Cole become the hero, setting free the cookies/AI/Crew/[It doesn't go into more detail on this, because of course it doesn't].

Not only does this seemingly tell the viewer how to feel about the cookies rights and whether they are alive, when this was left more up to the viewers discretion in past seasons but, also displays a lack of consistency in this ""black mirror universe"" it feels they are pushing more and more towards. If you repeat the same concepts and same themes, in the same way as a past episode, why is the world view so different in the two cases.

In one, even the police find it reasonable to cause the cookie to suffer, just for a bit of fun really. Whilst, in the other episode, even though it seems the ability to create your own cookies is seemingly far easier, it is seen as the writers as equal to causing someone suffering in the real world, given the ending which i will not spoil.

This is all before mentioning how technology is becoming more and more the focus, rather than humanities response to the technology, before mentioning how filler so much of the episodes feel whilst not explaining the important concept, before mentioning how many surface level flaws are present in recent episodes and before mentioning how they would rather force feed an opinion than raise discussion, the only discussion it raises is about the show, rather than the broader world around us.

I feel at this point, its safe to assume that, for me, the black mirror from season 1&amp;2 is dead. However i'm aware that a lot of people still love the show so i'd love to know your opinions.

8186,1514970787,7ntjk2,False,11,5,"The following is my personal opinion, and should be taken as such. Y'all are entitled to your own opinions. Don't be sheep.

**Season 4 Tier List:**

S Tier:

- *Hang the DJ*: Probably the best episode of the season, has a lot to say about modern dating/relationships. Great relationship between the leads, and ultimately very satisfying.
- *USS Callister*: A big risk for Booker as it breaks the typical structure and expectations of a Black Mirror episode. I love the inversions of several tropes in this episode, such as how the main antagonist of the episode would likely be the nerdy protagonist of a 80s film like *Revenge of the Nerds.* Did not really enjoy the episode as much as I do now on my initial viewing.

A Tier:

- *Metalhead*: I wrote [a more detailed breakdown of my thoughts on this episode](https://www.reddit.com/r/blackmirror/comments/7mrqjc/black_mirror_episode_discussion_s04e05_metalhead/ds2np7h/) on the discussion board for the episode. Feel free to check it out if you somehow care enough about a stranger's irrelevant comment to pry deeper. Ultimately, I love the visual style and portrayal of the post-apocalyptic dystopia in the episode, as well as the sheer efficient brutality of the 'dogs' in the episode.
- *Black Museum*: Very densely-packed episode that does a really great job of exploring the relationship between technology and human consciousness. Stumbles at points, but has an awesome payoff. *Black Museum* also contains several critiques of American politics, racial relations, and healthcare. The episode is being compared to *White Christmas* (for good reason), and it is clear that this episode takes many cues its predecessor, but I don't think that's a bad thing.

B Tier:

- *Crocodile*: Stylistically is a very impressive feat. Nails the feelings of isolation and desolation in its amazing establishing and landscape shots. The issue with the episode lies with the recaller, as it is a somewhat predictable and unexciting device when compared to some other technologies explored this season (such as the security drones in *Metalhead*). Aside from that, the decision-making of Andrea Riseborough's character in the episode seems a bit spotty, and the big twist of the episode makes the episode feel very stark and nihilistic. Not a bad episode at all, but one that feels ultimately futile for all of the characters involved in it. I understand that this was likely the intent of Booker and John Hillcoat, but it definitely was not my favorite episode of the season. 

C Tier:

- *Arkangel*: A really unbalanced episode directed by Jodie Foster. Focuses on the mother-daughter relationship between Marie and Sara, wherein Marie (the concerned mother) eventually has an implant placed in her daughter to track her location, health, sight, and more. The episode criticizes issues with parenting such as censorship and its effects on a child's development, but is rather uninteresting. The story beats in the episode feel predictable, and the 'twist' of the episode feels less like a twist, and more like a wtf moment thrown into the story for shock value. Of all the episodes this season, this is the only one I can genuinely say feels like a filler *Black Mirror* episode. The rest of the episodes in the season feel unique and take risks, whereas *Arkangel* feels as though it is trying to mimic an episode like *The Entire History of You* or *Be Right Back*, wherein the plot has a very simple premise/structure, but the technology within it subverts viewers expectations in a way that makes the experience memorable or fresh. However, unlike the aforementioned episodes, *Arkangel* is simply not as interesting, and ultimately feels as though it drags on for way too long.",False,blackmirror,Black Mirror Season 4 Tier List
8187,1514970232,7nti76,False,20,4,"USS Callister - Daly is beat and the crew is free 
Arkangel - Sarah escapes her mother and is free
Crocodile - there is justice for all the murder victims. This one is debatable because for the main character the ending is sad. But through the episode it made you care more about Shazia and her family, so therefore I saw the justice as a “happy ending.” 
Hang the DJ - They’re free to date with a 99.8% match
Metalhead - The only deeply devastating/depressing ending
Black Museum - Justice and Nish is a badass 

All in all it seems that season 4 had 5 out of 6 happy endings for the season. In all of the other seasons the endings were depressing other than san junipero (in my opinion). Then because all of the other episodes had a horrific ending that made me enter each episode thinking “try to think the worst, this is all going to end horribly.” So because I had this mind set I was extremely pleasantly surprise by san junipero and it’s bittersweet ending. 

This season they gave so many episodes happy(ish) endings, it really stripped away a layer from the series that I loved. Do not get me wrong I loved black museum and hang the DJ.

I was obsessed with LOST when it came out, so much so that I would make people sit in silence or leave the room when it came on. Now I'm finding myself doing that with Black Mirror. What LOST did at one point was challenge the norm. They jumped between flash backs and flash forwards. Right now the feel is all these episodes (Black Mirror) are independent, but what if they're not. What if they're just not in the right order. 

So then we got to talking and thinking about what the shows about. Technology, right? Kinda. But it seems to be more about how technology messes with our lives, changes our culture, and how some of the stuff in the show isn't necessarily far fetched. 

At least that is how I describe it to anyone who says, ""I don't get it, what's it about?"" The next question usually is, ""what's the best episode?"" Since they're independent I usually say, ""White Christmas."" There are some GREAT episodes and some, ""meh"" ones. For me ""Fifteen Million Merits"" was a ""meh"" one. I started to describe it and couldn't really explain why these people were biking. What was the reason for all the porn? Then it hit me...Because they're slaves. Slaves to machines who need energy, machines that one day figured out they don't need humans. So the bike creates energy, and they bombard them with tech to motivate them (Nosedive). The porn is because machines realize they need humans to reproduce and they need stimulation for this (Shut up and Dance). helps reproduce. It's the world's end. An end that came from the advancement of tech. So the show does connect. It's just in a random order. We've read the about the Easter Eggs, but the trick is ordering them in the right order. Watching from the early advancements to something like San Junipero. Where Kelly and Yorkie are wearing very futuristic clothing. The headpiece in that episode, same one as USS Callister. Where the guy gets stuck in his game!

So in the first discussion I had with people we decided he must have died. He got stuck in the game, so when his human body dies so does his game body. A better punishment would have been permanent life in that little ship. But in San Junipero, that's exactly what they do. So they must learn that through this tech you can create everlasting life in whatever world you want.

[Spoiler Alert](/s ""So as many people have pointed out, Season 4 as a whole seemed to be extremely focused on the characters' consciousness being transplanted... like, almost EVERY episode. Episode 6, ""Black Museum"", was like that on steroids. In earlier seasons, we had examples of plenty of episodes that involved technology that was not an implant or involved going into people's minds. The burning museum, which was a symbol of the Black Mirror universe coalescing, most likely is the writers saying they're done with technology-based stories involving consciousness.

Now I've seen this discussion before, but somehow the more I think about it the more I'm convinced the eternal stimulated afterlife portrayed in that episode is actually really depressing. Sure you can keep doing literally anything you feel like forever, but at a certain point it has to become so terribly depressing. I mean even if there's an infinite amount of different afterlife-'content' to be experienced, the very experience of doing something new will eventually become dull in itself, no? While it's a bit more obvious that the partying portrayed in the episode gets old fast, as you can see in that Quagmire-club where everything is dark and everyone has moved on to more extreme hedonistic pleasure as a way to keep from getting bored. Given an infinite amount of time everything is just bound to become meaningless after a while. I know in the episode they can 'delete' themselves from San Junipero to kind off 'die for real', but that not my point. The point is that given an infinite amount of happy experiences and pain and worry-free life, there still is an option to end it all because all that somehow won't be enough. Does that mean that live has not enough to offer to keep on living for ever?

Now don't get my wrong, I do really like having fun and/or hedonistic-type experiences. But in my relatively short amount of time living, I've felt the undertones of meaninglessness that I'm getting from San Junipero really resonate with me. The scene where people in that dark club Quagmire are desperately trying to have fun by doing things more extreme especially. I've been to similar clubs in real life actually where theres just hordes of people hedonistically ""living in the moment"" (altough not as over the top and without all the bdsm-type stuff), and even in the midst dancing the night away on chemically induced euphoria I've had the sobering thought that feeling like this forever would eventually start to really suck.

The only episodes in the present to us are Shut up and The National Anthem, these are followed by Hated in the Nation and the Waldo Moment (which is spurred by disillusion due to the drone insects social media take over). Social media becomes regulated by government, which has ceased to exist, rather being corporations. White Bear Justice Park is created to punish criminals and create entertainment for the considerably smaller, yet more populist society, 

Smaller nation from Hated in the Nation causes wealth for more people. Technology is also more advanced and cheaper. San Junipero and Crocodile occur in this period. The globe becomes far more connected and people must sign up and be ‘identified’ by the system for insurance and security, Mia becomes the subject of a similar fate to Victoria. 

Society becomes more automotive and people no longer have to work if they are wealthy enough. Work becomes largely optional thanks to Universal Basic Income introduction, Some want to work to prove themselves (the entire history of you). Ark angel also occurs around this time. 

The globe eventually all succumb to a basic income system, but political manipulation from both sides of the spectrum means constant adjustment, with a class system remaining in place (Nosedive).

Eventually society collapses, with many breaking out of the system and forming a resistance. Government makes them out to be ‘roaches’ and deploys soldiers to get rid of non-inscrit communities. Eventually, soldiers become less keen to sign up and also supply is down. An entrepreneur creates cyber dogs to destroy resistance movements and communities. They can identify them because they are non inscrit and free of data. This leads the way for Metalhead.

Yes, there probably should be more diversity in tech which should be shown through the writing, but I wouldn't necessarily expect it to be a massive spectrum. Eventually, you're going to have crossovers because it's in the same timelines. 

The tech in 'Playtest' had terrible consequences so don't expect much more from it as it was probably outlawed in the Black Mirror universe. If it does pop backup, it will be written in as 'illegal tech', probably, and contained within a much different story.

The tech in 'White Christmas' was clearly beneficial to law enforcement, so we were shown additional iterations of the tech in new stories that branch off of it in different ways as it was kept around for useful purposes.

'USS Callister' gave a name to it and showed the 'Infinity' program which was used in San Junipero. Same universe. Same program. *Much* different story.

We are not given a year/timeline in these episodes, which is intentionally, I assume, to avoid locking the writers into new tech/timelines. I would suggest sticking with a simple like/dislike of the episodes/stories rather than focusing on new tech. 

The fanbase, or this subreddit at least, is very split between ""too dark for me, dislike"" and ""I love the irony and dark twists, love it!"" so why not just keep that approach episode to episode?",False,blackmirror,I would like to give my opinion of the criticism regarding reused technology / similar technology in the new season

People that want to learn how to make their favorite dishes? They can become Gordon Ramsay over night. All they do is set the device to download anything they want to learn and it “teaches” the skill and/or knowledge to their brain directly.

Which, for him, means an immense database of arguments, facts, data, and anything else he could need to crush his opponent. It also becomes helpful when trying to impress women (Think good will hunting).

This finally puts him definitively over the top, and is set to become the new governor. However, in the weeks leading up to the election, his thirst for omniscience begins to destroy him. His entire philosophy changes. He becomes a nihilist. A devout social Darwinist...A monster. His morality completely dissolves and leaves him with the conviction that no one else is real. That everyone else is just an illusory projection. The area of his brain that affects self-control, humility, tolerance, etc... is displaced by the storage load of his device.

I've been a really avid dreamer for 7 years now and a Black Mirror fan for a little over one, but today was the first time I had a nightmare about Black Mirror! In the dream, I am in a tall tower surrounded by a cold, empty parking lot, and (forgive me for the forgotten details) I see something I know I should not be seeing, in the top room of the tower, which is like a sort of dirty bedroom, with bright-colored dirty laundry lying all over the floor and trinkets on the table. I don't remember what it is, but when I see it, I have this feeling of badly needing to escape the tower before anyone in there sees that I've been in the room. I walk at what I hope is a brisk but calm-looking pace down the stairs when I run into Kevin Spacey, who, because it is a tower with single-room floors, can easily see which room I have just come from. I giggle nervously and say something like, ""I've just forgotten something in here,"" and head back into the room at a slightly quicker pace. He begins to follow me purposefully, so I break into a run and go out of the tower window, climbing down. I spend the rest of the dream hiding behind cars and watching Kevin Spacey wander the parking lot with his hands in his jacket pockets, just looking for me. 

It was so clear to me when I woke up that this bad dream was directly influenced by my having watched 'Crocodile'! I was in the place of Shazia of course, and Kevin played a mean Mia in my dream. What stuck out to me the most upon waking was the feeling I had right after seeing the Bad Thing. It was like a paralysis, because of the immediate and pressing need to appear calm I felt, but it was also a palpable fear, a strong desire to escape. I remember smiling on my way down the stairs, and walking at a reasonable pace, but feeling like there was no possible way I could reach the bottom soon enough. It was very interesting to me how stressful that was. When I watched the episode, I couldn't help thinking to myself, ""Shazia, be cool, be cool!!!"" but after having this dream, I honestly have to admit to myself I may have met the same fate.

I felt like they tried to jam-pack a ton of themes in this episode and fleshed out zero of them, which was the complete opposite of most episodes this season. 

- I don't like Rolo as a character at all and I think they made him too much of a crazy sadist later on in the episode... if the idea was to show that his own inventions corrupted him over time, they should've executed it better.

- Rolo as an unreliable narrator is an idea they barely emphasized - he lies about the boner and about the prisoner having his family not care about them but besides that it isn't really clear that the stories he are telling are very manipulated.

- The twist ending is super obvious (not what happens but that something will happen) because of how much they bring attention to how hot it is in the museum over and over

- I get that they're trying to make Rolo Charlie Brooker and the museum goers people watching Black Mirror, and bring up the idea of watching the show to make yourself disturbed as some form of sadism, but it's not explained very well.

-  All the references personally made me roll my eyes, like if we couldn't get all the super obvious references to earlier episodes before, we would definitely have to go ""oh, that's the tablet we just saw a few episodes ago!""

- I understand they're trying to show the worst of humanity throughout the episode, but I found the first story to be tasteless and gratuitously violent, way more violent than the rest of the show. It got to a point where it was hilariously campy and ridiculous, and the message could definitely have gone across with much less gore. 

- The theme of racism in this episode was completely and utterly underutilized. They silently worked in this narrative where nearly all the antagonists in the story were black, and even showed all the museum-goers being white, to shove in this commentary of white people ogling at the atrocities in black history in museums, but it's simply not done well at all.

- This also goes for theme of capitalism, where the episode tried to establish that Rolo was a businessman who only cared about profits, but they spent too little time at the end explaining the downfall of the museum and how it ended up being his own downfall.

- The second story is interesting but quickly gets kinda boring and predictable, aside from the monkey part, which is actually very interesting. (along with Rolo's explanation of cookie rights).

- The third story seems cut way too short, probably because the first is too long, but also maybe because they wanted it to be short purposefully for main character to become part of it.

- The reveal that her mother is in her head just is too cheesy for me and goes against the moral of the second episode.

- The decision to blow their load over a shared universe and wasting it on this episode where it doesn't really go anywhere is just really annoying to me and it almost seemed too tryhard for me.

Although he is capable as an adult, and technically brilliant, he is still clearly emotionally underdeveloped. He has no interest in sexual exploits. At first, he’s mostly relatable. His office has a full collection of Space Fleet and his apartment is decorated with figurines—not too different than many of ourselves or people we know. But then we notice his afternoon beverage of choice: not a beer, but chocolate milk, which is typically seen as a child’s beverage. This stereotypical picture of an adolescent gamer is then continued by casually interrupting the battle with his nemesis to go get his delivery pizza.

When it comes time for the women is kiss Daly to celebrate the end of their mission, the main character is assured by Shania Lowry that there is “…never tongue” in order to maintain the purity of his fantasy. He appears sexually innocent. Daly even opted to not include genital simulation to keep the purity of the universe—making them look just like action figures. When Cole takes off her uniform to awkwardly seduce Daly to join her for a swim, he is unable to pick up the obvious signs of a ploy since he is untrained against that kind of flattery.

His immaturity is further shown when he yells “look! A naked lady!” to distract the Valdack during their mission. When he loses his temper it’s reminiscent of a toddler having a temper tantrum. The way everyone talks to him is like Star Trek played by the wiggles. When they burst into singing “for he’s a jolly good fellow!” it’s like a kid being showered with praise at a birthday party. It’s how day care workers would talk to a child. When he dipped into the lake for a few moments, I halfway expected Cole to say “Wow! Look how long you could hold your breath!”.

Not as related to childhood symbolism, but I also wanted to comment on how James Walton acts as a character foil. Walton is clearly a stuck-up asshole, but Daly’s response to him is equally inappropriate. He is the CTO of the company, he should be able to stick up for ideas that would be good for the product. This is highlighted when the update patch deadline is pushed back. Walton is humiliated as a CEO when he finds out about the deadline through the media instead of his own partner.

8348,1514933716,7nq60n,False,19,114,"I know a lot of people didn't really like it, but this episode hit me really, really hard. I grew up gay in a very homophobic household, and once I was outed my life became really, really difficult until I was able to move out. This episode was especially terrifying for me because the mere idea that my parents might have (and even now, to a lesser extent) had access to that kind of technology just chills me to the bone. I was especially sickened because the things Sarah was doing (minus perhaps [minor spoiler I guess?](/s ""the cocaine"")) were very normal, expected teenager stuff, and her mother had only the best of intentions towards her daughter in spite of poor execution. But imagine abusive parents with this sort of technology and the control they'd have over their kids. The only way I was able to make it through high school was my ability to lie and hide very convincingly. If even that had been taken from me, I shudder to think what my parents could have done. For me, that's the REAL horror of this episode--if the Arkangel system went so badly for a loving parent with good intentions, how much worse might its effects be on a more broken family? Gay or trans kids in abusive houses would have absolutely no escape. Kids who were beaten or molested would know they were always being watched and would be even more unable to reach out for help. Forget ""helicopter parenting."" It's scary, but it's not the half of what surveillance like this could do for controlling parents. 

On another note, the ending. It might seem somewhat extreme for Sarah to react the way she did, but for anyone who's suffered that kind of humiliation, the hurt and betrayal is very, very understandable. You can't escape, so you want to lash out. I have been in a very similar position to Sarah, and it's the most terrifying, sickening feeling you can imagine. Fortunately I didn't react like she did, but I can absolutely understand why she'd do it. And that's why this episode was one of the best of this season for me--because I related to it a little too much. Because I wonder if I might have wanted to do the same thing.

I don’t know why all the episodes were female centric but it did bother me a bit - I preferred the diversity of S2 and S3, it allowed for more gender based stories such as San Junipero and Shut Up and Dance.

The whole Be Right Back episode dealt with the ""digital ghosts"", but it was imperfect at that point. They were able to create an artificial body, but the mind was still just a collection of approximations made through the digital traces we left behind when alive.

However, with the invetion of the neural net and cookies, that problem was completely solved. They can just upload that into the android and have a perfect copy of the person who died that keeps going.

I mean sure - the individual is subjectively still dead, but to the world, it makes little difference. Parents can cheat death and care for their kids instead of leaving them orphaned. People can care for their eldery parents. Genius minds can work way past their expiration and finish their work of a lifetime. Artists don't die and have a chance to give happiness to their fans forever.

What I mean to say is that there would be some insanely positive implications to the technology we have seen as well. 

Of course, Black Mirror always has to turn bitter by the end, so then we could delve into the issue of overpopulation and segregation between the ""surviving"" androids and the new generations of people whom would be miles behind the longest living cookies as far as knowledge and experience go.

And before you say anything, I am aware that this is an anthology and that some episodes clearly don't take place in the same world as others (or they do, theorize away, I won't judge). However, if we think strictly of the Black Museum episode and see all the connections and the precise technology they have, it's not unreasonable to think they eventually upgraded from monkey dolls to androids as seen in Be Right Back.

You take DNA (in white Christmas it was a procedure) and make digital versions of people to do with them as you please. It was disappointing seeing them rehash an idea from a previous episode since most episodes are really unique, but it has some funny moments and some great ones.

Episode 2 was kinda worse. I get that the main character is an overprotective mom that only wants best for her daughter so we can’t judge her too harshly. if that’s the case, why even introduce the grandpa character? He’s gone 15 minutes in and even though he’s likable, he makes the episode’s jumps in time so much more unbelievable.

So you’re Lying on the floor dying, while your granddaughter watches you without feeling a thing. She doesn’t help you or does anything. You survive this and live for a few more years, and you don’t tell anything to your daughter about it??? If my granddaughter just stared at me blankly because of some parental block while I died and I survived that, I’d tell my daughter she’s ruining her child’s life, not letting her experience any sort of pain or fear.

The whole conflict of ideas has obvious right and wrong answers, but the episode will keep showing it to us as a complicated situation just because the main character is an overprotective mother.

The way I see it, we've had three really good episodes, two alright ones and then a sub-par one imo. But I'm gonna rate them all for y'all bc I'm bored lol.

USS Callister - some people have been saying on here that they didn't like this one very much, or that it lacked spark, but I completely disagree. I think the concept was wonderful and daring, the acting from the ensemble cast (which we rarely see in BM) is fantastic, and the overall comedic tone worked well. Writing at times was a bit odd, but I loved the way the narrative flowed and the story pieced together lots of other ideas from different episodes. Ending was very satisfying, Daly trapped in the spaceship was reminiscent of the ending to White Christmas, which I enjoyed. Bonus points to King of Space Aaron Paul at the end as well. - 8.5/10

Arkangel - one thing I really enjoyed about this episode is the emphasis on the dangers of helicopter parenting and how human nature can affect yourself and the ones you love. However, it just lacks the edge that I've come to expect from this show. It obviously tries to demonstrate itself as one of the darker episodes of the season, but the storyline lacks depth and the narrative feels a bit stretched out (i.e. could've been longer). But, the episode is still entertaining in its own right, and a strong performance from Rosemarie DeWitt as a mother gives it a few more points. - 7/10

Crocodile - this is an interesting one. As I watched it, I was thoroughly engrossed in the beautiful cinematography, and I was definitely on the edge of my seat with intensity, biting my nails aggressively. But after the episode, I kept finding points to critique. It was acted superbly by every performer, but even the acting and the cinematography doesn't make up for a convoluted and repetitive plot. The twist at the end felt like a forced ""happy"" ending and the whole murderous rampage thing meant the episode lost its Black Mirror feel. It's a very well-made episode, well-acted all around and the usage of technology is interesting, but I can't justify the story much. - 7/10

Hang the DJ - in my opinion definitely a top 5 episode of the whole show. The chemistry of the lead two actors was brilliant - it felt so natural watching them on screen that the minutes just passed as I was so engrossed in the story. The story had plenty of depth, such that even with 20/25 minutes left there were many pathways I felt the story could go, but I was so pleased with how it went. The concept that built up from the original idea was thoroughly interesting to watch (the simulations from the whole expiry thing, subverting expectations in regards to the technological aspect was ingenious) and I just loved it. - 9.5/10

Metalhead - I've seen some in-depth analyses of this episode, but I just cannot bring myself to enjoy it. Personally, the cinematography was astounding and kept me somewhat engaged, and the lead actress was solid, but it just didn't feel intense enough, or thought-provoking in any way. Just felt to me as an oversimplified episode of a woman running from a mechanical dog, and by the end it felt pointless, as if she just gave up despite everything. The teddy bears felt like a forced attempt at a heart-breaking/heart-warming idea. - 5/10

Black Museum - WOW. From the offset this felt so enjoyable to watch. I warm to the whole anthology concept (White Christmas is my favourite episode, bar this one) and it is just executed brilliantly. The three intertwining stories were intriguing, well-acted and exciting, Douglas Hodge was absolutely fantastic, (passing Bryce Dallas Howard (Nosedive) for the best performance of the show so far for me) and the twist at the end was so unexpected and well-done, as I really believed something bad would happen to Nish due to Rolo Haynes' sadistic nature. On top of that, there's this whole idea I've seen circulating that Black Museum was a representation/parody of the show itself, with Brooker represented by Haynes as a sort of sadistic technology enthusiast with a penchant for demonstrating violence to the world, with the people responding with such delight and popularity (as shown by the brief clip of when the museum was popular). Personally I love that theory, and it adds another layer of icing on an already delicious cake. - 10/10

Arkangel and Crocodile are meh,

I view Crocodile as one of the most heavy-handed, well-directed episodes that uses technology to show people's instincts of panic and putting themselves before others, which is exactly what I think Black Mirror is about.

Black Mirror isn't a show about technology, it's a show about how terrible people can be if technology gives them the power. Crocodile gives power to the authority by making it so Mia can't lie. No one can lie.

The dread of hiding (multiple) murders in a situation where you physically can't lie leads for Mia to fall into a depression and panic and creates an incredibly tense scene with Mia and Shazia.

Speaking of scenes, this is by far the best directed and most visually appealing episode of Black Mirror. The beautiful landscapes, the framed portraits of panic/dread/worry in beautiful buildings, and the last five minutes may be the best ending overall, to any Black Mirror episode. The acting of Andrea Riseborough during the performance is amazing, and the music gradually getting more and more intense to contrast with the happy children's performance is exactly what I love seeing from the directing in Black Mirror.

The guinea pig twist isn't completely out of the blue: the guinea pig could definitely be attached to symbolism with the memory device itself, and the use of pets with the device is something I, personally, was waiting to see.

Overall, I can understand some wanting to see a more action or technology-based episode, but I love Black Mirror's take on a killer's perspective in a world where you can't lie to the machine.",True,blackmirror,My opinion on Crocodile (spoilers)

8479,1514908268,7nn7cs,False,3,52,,True,blackmirror,[SPOILERS] [S4E2] When S4 memes u
8480,1514908143,7nn6vr,False,95,138,"As soon as I saw the Arkangel I came to Reddit read reviews and found frustrating that a lot of people really disliked the episode. I figured out that it is an episode with different pace then other BM episodes and one in which the technology is almost a detail, but I found it a very good episode. Here is why:


The Arkangel is about super-protective parents and how their paranoia becomes more important then the son's well being (which is what they think is their greatest goal). In that aspect Marie is the main character and the opening scene makes it clear that she has a lot of fear (when the doctors clean the baby) and guilty (she thinks the C-Section in necessary because _she_ didnt push hard enough). We can see her paranoia in the playground scene, but she is still someone balanced and rational: she question herself if it is a good idea to filter stressful images from Sara, tells the truth about the system to Sara and eventually realizes its better for everyone if she shuts down the tablet. We see that she continues to be protective (giving so many probiotics) and when a stressful event takes place (the lake night) the paranoia comes back and it is now stronger: Marie uses the Arkangel without Sara's knowledge and lies to her. That's important because before that their relationship was the most important thing to Marie and her control over the daughter came second, while now things changed. When she sees Sara sniffing coke, Marie goes full crazy and harms her daughter (making the boyfriend simply disappear) to satisfy her craziness. From that point on, paranoia completely tooks over.


Its interesting that Marie had a second chance: even though the Arkangel traumatized and harmed the little Sara, the girl managed to overcome the difficulties imposed by the system and becomes a functional young adult (feeding the dog was the symbol of it). But the mother's paranoia was still there and it was a question of time to another incident take place. The first warning (Sara's ""autism"" and that slap in her mothers face) couldnt be enough to control Marie's issues: a paranoid person is constantly looking for an excuse to do what she knows is wrong, and eventually will find. The story is doomed to be repeated and Sara's 2nd rage attack against that control will be like the 1st one, but way stronger. In the end, the episode shows that it doesn't matter the grandfather's warnings (Marie just shows him the middle finger), the slap Sara gives her or even her acknowledge of how harmful and wrong the system could be, Marie wont control herself. We may argue that Marie knew where all would lead, but couldnt change the way she was

Other interesting points:

* just like Edipo's history (which is cited during Sara's class), in Arkangel a parent trying to avoid their son's / daughter's destiny ends up making it a self-fulfilling prophecy

* when the doctor turns on Sara's vision cast for the 1st time, the girl says ""Mommy, it's funny!"". She was talking about the show on tv or she could feel something caused by the system?

* when Mairie turns off the Arkangel Sara tells her friend ""_She_ turned the system off"". Normally a kid would say ""My mom turner the system off"". Maybe thats Sara already trying to establish a distance from her mother

Things that could be different:

As well as returning to a place of mediocrity and in my opinion a place of notability in the series.

This episode was perfect at the start. The colors on the screen from the first moment can make a long time viewer of this series take a moment to think about what's going to be different here.  When you're talking about black mirror, I believe that you have to pay more attention to the asthetic and world design more than the characters. Driving up to the warehouse and starting the heist for unknown objects with wonderful sound design and music increasing in intensity was more intense in 5 minutes that feature films do in 2 hours. From the moment that we see the first dog, we know that stakes are high.

Most people feel like you don't care about the characters, but at this moment, you do. The explosive tracking devices and a character being incinerated within moments are extremely jarring and without the film noir style bringing your eyes to the action and investigation, it wouldn't be as shocking or thrilling.  The subsequent car chase and waiting for her friend to drive is just as gut wrenching. Minor conveniences here and there after the cliff but we'll talk about the radio portion.

She manages to get the tracker our and without explicitly saying what it is, we know what it is, which I appreciate. The next 20 or so minutes is take it or leave it, but the final scene was extremely emotional. 

The final explosion of the dog, makes you feel frustration and irriation. Which is what it was supposed to. And the shot showing the final would was expected, but still well done. The first 15 minutes alone make this episode worth the watch.

I don't think this episode is one of the best, but definitely one of the better of the season. Too many shows are exposition factories. This one, we are meant to create the universe in which is takes place. Wasteland could be theorized by tons of people and we'd never know how things ended up that way. We are shown things, not told them. That's why this episode was good. In my opinion.

If I didn't change your opinion. So be it. However, there's plenty to praise here. Rewatch it yourself, and enjoy the darker and more stripped down black mirror.

It added a lot to my analysis of the show, but I had other categories in my head for episode groupings, including some overlaps. This exercise helped organize my thoughts on the story, which I will lay out below. The most useful categories to me were in terms of episode themes. These themes are: the relationship between justice and abuse, living within a fantasy, social pressure, and episodes which, while extremely well-written, seem to be devices for explaining the new technology in the show.

Justice/Abuse

White Bear

Shut Up and Dance

Men Against Fire (overlaps with Living in Fantasy category)

Arkangel

Crocodile



Living in Fantasy

Fifteen Million Merits (theory being, this is a view into a sentient AI game like USS Callister)

Be Right Back

Playtest

San Junipero

Men Against Fire (overlaps with Justice/Abuse category)

USS Callister

Hang the DJ

Metalhead (theory being, this is a view into another sentient AI game like USS Callister)



Social Pressure

The National Anthem

The Entire History of You

Nosedive

The Waldo Moment

Hated in the Nation



Explain the Tech

White Christmas

Black Museum


This is a great strategy for analyzing wtf is going on in this show. This season has convinced me that all of the episodes take place within about 20 years of each other, and that the episode closest to our time is one of the political ones, possibly Hated in the Nation or The Waldo Moment (or maybe Shut Up and Dance), which I think are all supposed to take place sometime in the 2020s. 

The very weird and highly stylized stories that don't seem to take place in the same setting as most of the others (15 Million Merits, Metalhead) are likely glimpses into the brave new worlds of sentient AI. I think both of these episodes demonstrate a game OVERTAKEN by AI, so the AIs have very limited or no interaction with natural people anymore. I feel that this was revealed when we saw Jack reading the Merits comic book in Black Museum. Merits is clearly a story the natural Black Mirror universe has heard of. why wouldn't a USS Callister situation be feasible for other stories?

I appreciate that the daughter protagonist in Black Museum mentions political protests about her father. Other episodes allude to social uprisings, so I think we are seeing the before, during, and after of something like a civil war. I think the political climate of the natural world degenerated into chaos in the 2020s and technology made criminals capable of astonishing acts of violence, culminating in the mass murder of the #deathto hashtag users. This chaos allowed the superwealthy to establish corporations to create ethically questionable tech... Likely applauded at every step of the way, too, because they probably also offered stronger surveillance tools than mechanical bees against these new supercriminals. As the tech companies grew, r&amp;d comes up with crazy shit. And the corporations prolly begin exploring cookie technology, at least at first, cuz it created exquisite pornography. The museum attendant's company, which we saw based in St. Juniper hospital, prolly had origins in porn and opportunists saw the chance to expand into not-porn applications.

I believe the message at the heart of this show is not that TECHNOLOGY creates social breakdown, but that folks with money and power do. I can't see a show that shows rich suits jacking off to torturing an innocent man as sympathetic towards the superwealthy. The show seems to present the idea that while individuals retain a sense of self and conscientious throughout any experience, the superwealthy understand how to manipulate mass emotional reactions based in fear and sex. They just happen to be doing it with advanced tech instead of like, propaganda films.

8512,1514899099,7nmd6p,False,0,4,"Dont know if anyone posted it before but just wanted to share my thoughts on something..
Episodes 1-5 has all those easter eggs like on crocodile the porn selection had wrath babes, they talked about hotshot (talent show from 15MM) at the hotel, the song that was playing is the same song she sang at that episode.
Or like on ep.1 the black lady is the same actress as in nosedive’s airport counter (s3ep1) and she asked for brushed suede- same coffee from nosedive. etc etc..
And then we get to the black museum episode which tells what we all figured out: its a shared universe.
Now, The initial response is to be disappointed by the fact that we have already seen many of those technologies before.. but maybe its about more than what mankind can do with super high tech, maybe its about progress.. look, it all started with san junipero.. all those people got “conscious cloned” to live their new virtual life on some giant server farm.. then the same tech got better, became mobile and we had the cookies from white Christmas. We allready knew how to make virtual selves, same tech.
The next step is to successfully insert that virtual clone into someone’s head. It adds up as we see in the second story that the woman who got hit by a bus and wind up in saint junipero hospital to get that treatment. so we can see the connection.
The final nail in the coffin was when this tech became such a household thing that people could actually take home as a souvenir a suffering virtual man to last forever. 
And the more you think about it the more it appears, it could be the same tech we saw on be right back, the dude died and the company tried to duplicate his consciousnesses from stuff online (same tech- in absence of a real brain) to some sort of vessel and it ended up being stored in the attic, pretty much same thing that happened to the lady in the yellow monkey, just more advanced. 
And in hang the dj- the futuristic tinder uses the same tech just to check something different, he creates virtual clones into his environment to test the scenario. 
So i wasn’t angry about them using their “old tricks” this season, I thought it was tying some of the ends together for bigger, more ominous message about progress- classic black mirror.

I really like Black Mirror although this season I had to move forward with the 5th episode because the episode wasn’t telling me anything.

Anyways, my question is simple, is Black Mirror “abusing” the resource of the conscience and/or the cookies thing?

To be honest, Hang the DJ uses it briefly and at the end and doesn’t even mention it, USS Calister uses it too but is not the center of it, however, to me, while Black Museum tells different stories and all of them use it, reminds me a lot of white Christmas by creating that anguish with the same resource.

Don’t get me wrong, I love Black Mirror and I enjoyed those episodes, is just that I think that, even if used for a different reason or telling a different story, it doesn’t feel the same when you realize the resource used is the same. Be it by creating the NPCs with own conscience in USS Calister, or by using the “Tinder” app in Hang the DJ or by basically everything in the short stories in Black Museum.

I loved how Arkangel and Crocodile felt. How they used an event to trigger everything and then use technology to bind everything together. And how they used our fears and something that can happen to everyone, but I liked they didn’t use the “read conscience” or “upload/download” thing to tell the story.

I remember how first season every episode was so different and now I feel that even tho three of this season episodes are completely different (USS Calister, Hang the DJ and Black Museum) they still use the same resource.

I think the main issue I have is that the torture thing of Black Museum reminds me a lot of White Christmas. The first story is really great because it goes against of the conscience upload but then, I don’t know, it just feel, not “cheap” but that it could have been different. Feels like USS Calister and/or Hang the DJ could have been small stories of Black Museum because of how they played with the conscience.

8522,1514895477,7nm3q1,False,3,7,"I think this season is more about justice than our technological prowess surpassing our cultural enlightenment. This is most evident in Callister and most importantly in Black Museum. I don't know why but something about seeing what we believe to be justice being doled out makes the human brain go ""Oh fuck yeah you bitch get justiced *braingasm*""; at least it does in my brain. I don't know why we're like this but justice feels so fucking good, right? Think back to the last time you saw what you consider being ""just"" happening. Did it feel good? It probably did.

Near the end Black Museum we see the sick pleasure people take from pulling the lever on Clayton. They are in their own eyes serving out justice. It is practically the biblical version of hell, *Eternal Torture*. We even see Clayton's wife saying something like ""but baby this is your soul"". No one deserves that. Even if you're the worst person in human history who is responsible for the slaughter of millions (Caesar and the guals, Genghis Khan and all of continental Asia, Hitler and Europe, Hirohito and the Chinese, etc) you don't deserve that. How many times should a person be put through a process that would normally kill them until they are ""absolved"" of their sins? (I should point out the victims and those close to them are absolutely justified for wanting revenge, also I do not condone genocide).

Now here is the part where I tell you why I feel like scum, and you should too if you felt the same things I did. We see Clayton's torture and we see Rolo's face as he witnesses that on a daily basis. He's getting off similarly to how Dawson was and it's kind of sickening to look at. Then the big twist comes and Rolo gets a taste of his own medicine. Personally, my brain was fucking drowning in endorphins. I got a nice fuzzy feeling out of it actually. 

Then, I realized I was no better than the fuckers pulling the lever. Taking pleasure from the prospect of another's eternal suffering.

Most of the problems in Black Museum seem to stem from issues in the U.S., among them a healthcare system that preys upon people who cannot afford it, and a justice system that cares more about seeing someone who's supposedly a killer (a black one at that) being tortured for almost all of eternity.

The healthcare thing in particular really struck me. All of the people affected in the episode are victims of American issues, that Americans see as unavoidable, but are seen as ridiculous by many from other countries.

8524,1514894593,7nm1hq,False,1,1,"USS callister is probably my favorite episode this season but one thing really bothers me thinking about it. Most episodes of black mirror focus on somewhat plausible ""just out of reach tech"" nothing that would be considered impossible. 

This is what bothers me in USS Callister episode. The DNA digitizer that robert uses to make the crew from his coworkers DNA does not make any sense. My issue is that when the a new crew member is ""cloned"" into the simulation they somehow retain their recent memories and personality, they are not even aware that anything changed or that they are a clone in a simulation.

This tech makes sense in the cookies because those are based on implants that map the brain and so the cookie is just a digitised version of the brain with all the experience and memories. But there is no way someone's whole personality and memories would be stored in a cheek cell or something.

The only thing the DNA would be good for is creating an accurate copy of the body.

Also the final plan does not make much sense, so their goal is to steal the DNA samples so Daly can't make any more digital clones of them, and then kill themselves so he can no longer torment them. I mean that makes a big assumption that he does not have any digital copies of the sampled DNA, but ignoring that there is nothing in their plan to stop Daly just getting more DNA samples from the office and doing the exact same thing.

 As far as we know they had no idea that Daly would get stuck in the simulation, because if they knew that there would be no reason to have Nanette steal the samples from the fridge.

Seems like alot of things just unexpectedly fell into place to get a ""happy"" ending.

8525,1514894512,7nm19o,False,125,29,"First off, just let me say, I loved the episode as intended, Damon was definetly the bad guy who got what was coming to him, I cheered for the star ship crew when they got their freedom.

But I had sometime to think about it and it occurred to me that when you think about the tech, which is what Black Mirror is supposed to be all about, how we deal with tech and society in the future.  Wasn't Damon really just playing a futuristic, more advanced, AI version of The Sims?

Every one of us that has played The Sims has been a sadistic god to the characters in our little world we control.  Now I have not been a gamer since around the time of the original Sims game, I do not know what is out there since then but it is fair to say that games have probably increased some but not that much in the area of AI, mostly I think they have increased in the CPU/GPU area.  But I would assume that in the future, say 10/20/30 years that there will be a big leap to games having a strong AI presence.

Now granted in Callister that was true ""sci-fi"" using DNA samples to create a copy of a person, memories and all....

But who is to say that when these true AI like sims do exist that people are going to be just as sadistic to them as their dumb counterparts from the original Sims?  I don't think anyone will have a problem with it or see them equal as humans and think they should have right to exist or such.

So really what was Damon doing wrong, he wasn't hurting humans, he was being sadistic towards his Sims, nothing more... can we judge him anymore than ourselves for doing the same?

I remember an episode of Futurama where people were downloading copies of celebrities from the head museum onto robot blank bodies to become partners and sex robots.  And there was nothing wrong with that (other than the human race dying out as no one wanted to have sex with real human, but that's not the issue), the only reason they could show it was wrong in Futurama was that every download shocked the head it was copied from and thus hurt a real human.   But in Callister that was not the case, while there was maybe an invasion of privacy, no real human was harmed by taking a copy of their DNA from the garbage to make a SIM.

I think I am rambling here, but if I were to bring what Damon did into current times, sure he was a creep but no his boss was a total asshole to him who yelled at him in front of coworkers and took credit for what he created for the company.  If you had a boss like that how would you react, maybe you might do something like put your boss's picture on a dart board or a punching bag or if you had the tech you would create a character in one of the current video games named after them and to look like them as close as possible so you could kill them in that game.  Granted those things are not even remotely close to a DNA clone AI copy, but the  sentiment is the same.

I guess in the end it really comes down to how these virtual people are considered in the Callister or Black Mirror universe, are they just Sims or do they have human rights?  In fact at the end of callister we saw that they were now on the Internet and part of the larger game and any player could attack and kill them if they did not participate in a trade or the game.  To me that shows that they were nothing more than just characters.  Because I doubt they are the only ones, I am guessing that those DNA scanners are common and anyone can be put into games.",True,blackmirror,"SPOILERS: Did Walmart Matt Damon from Callister really do anything wrong, hear me out / play devil's advocate"

8561,1514878611,7nkzzo,False,0,3,"Hello everyone, just finished watching S4E04 Crocodile and skimmed through the episode megathread on the sub. I think most of us have concluded that Mia was arrested in the end due to her killing the child and letting the guinea pig witness it. 

I propose that the ending of this episode was left open intentionally (as we only see the police, but not the actual arrest), allowing for us to debate the capability and reliability of the *recaller's* technology. From this we would then discuss whether society ought to or not subscribe to allowing authorities to use such a device.

I believe that the *recaller* is insufficient in being able to provide evidence against Mia, especially since the information is drawn from a guinea pig. Thomas Nagel put forth a thought experiment in 1974 to argue against the reductive physicallist thought that mental states could be explained by physical states. His argument can be found [here](https://sites.google.com/site/philosophyofconsciousnessuofs/-what-is-it-like-to-be-a-bat). In summary (I think) the argument concludes that we cannot explain mental states with physical states, or if we could, we wouldn't know how to. Nagel uses the idea of a bat sensing by echolocation, and how we would never know this mental experience (though we might be able to describe it).  

I think this is a problem for the recaller. Early in the episode we hear that experiences are subjective and we see the dentist's memory of the emergency staff's jacket change from lime to yellow. Mia also attempts to manipulate her memory but imagining her eating. (But she might have eaten the food after the murder, suggesting it was a real memory, so this point isn't too strong). I think this could also motivate questions of discerning actual memories from dreams/imaginations.

I guess what I'm trying to say is, I don't think this episode was all about a bad character who had a comedic tragic ending, as some might have put forth in the megathread. I think there were ideas to discuss and I would like to discuss them with all of you! So what do you guys think? Can we clearly discern between our dreams, imagination and memories?

After watching Seasons 1-3, I've developed a natural expectation of every episode's ending (from my high expectations thanks to all previous BM episodes), only to be disappointed this season. I still enjoy it though, but I believe it has room for improvement.

What are your alternative endings to S4 episodes? Not to alter the actual story, but just the ending (the dark BM punch we get always in S1-3). Here are mine:

**USS Callister:**

- Captain Daly chases the crew into the wormhole

- They all make it, including Daly, now in original Infinity settings

- Daly eventually realizes he no longer has his controls, and is somehow unable to ""exit game"" (now forever trapped in the game, who knows what'll happen to his real-world body)

- The crew engages him, he is launched into space, then we see that outer-space death Walton described his son went through

- Then another scene that shows the crew (maybe 1 year later) are now the virtual admins of this game (they're the real-world admins, remember), with total control of the physics (revealing their individual tendencies to be just as sick as Daly, giving birth to a whole new meaning to ""Infinity"")

Another alternate ending:

- They all escape into Infinity

- Daly turns around, makes another copy of everyone in the Space Fleet mod, we see everyone in their first day as crewmen in Daly's command (and their initial collective tantrum, and Daly's torturous measures to make them comply)

- The escape means the whole world to the crew; it meant nothing to Robert Daly

**Arkangel**

- Sara leaves the house, hitchhikes, scene fades to black; scene cuts back to a matured Sara, now behaving more composed, with a 3-y/o child (she's a single mother)

- Arkangel is now on public release, she starts to consider it

- Understanding her mother now, Sara decides to take her child to ""visit grandma""

- They arrive, Sara's necklace (her copy of the front door key), still works to her surprise

- Sara notices her mom hasn't changed anything in the house since she left, she gets flashbacks of her childhood and her mother's dancing

- Sara smells her mom's cooking, gets excited, climbs up the stairs in her nostalgic joyous manner, carrying her 3-y/o child

- She sees her mummified mother holding the tablet, who died that day watching her run away through the broken screen

- She screams in horror/guilt

- Her baby watches her in total confusion, as she couldn't see her mummified grandma nor her mom's crying face

- Turns out she installed Arkangel on her daughter, and mistook the mummified odor for mom's cooking (if a scene like this was added early on; or at least the ""filter"" was also shown to alter sense of smell)

**Crocodile and Black Museum**

- Nothing changed, except it was Mia in place of Clayton in the Black Museum ending (and darker: the sadist clients don't just electrocute her but rape, mutilate, whatever)

- And maybe Crocodile being the last episode (right after Black Museum)

**Hang the DJ**

- After zooming out of the simulation, we see the real-world Frank and Amy as normal people in the same party

- They smile at one another casually, nothing special

- Amy's husband (not Frank) comes into the shot, turns out she's married

- Frank also leaves with his wife and their baby

- Turns out Amy and Frank have separate married lives, just ""swiping right"" out of boredom (or they're entertaining the thought of cheating, you decide)

**Metalhead**

- The box of white bears at the end make a sound: ""Teddy needs a hug"" (this one I read here somewhere)

**Black Museum**

Obviously, we have seen consciousness uploaded to the cloud or other types of ways to preserve human ""code"", but where do you think this lines up with faith vs science? 

Is the cookie actually a person, or is it only a line of code? We feel bad at the end of White Christmas when we find out the Joe we met is only a copy, and ""he"" has to spend the next 2.9 million years locked up in the same room, listening to the same song, over and over again. But the real Joe is in prison and faces a much more lenient sentence (presumably, at worst, execution, and at best, life in prison). 

Then in Black Museum we see that the primitive cookie was inserting a chip into a donor's head that the other person ""lived"" on, but even though it acts and sounds like the real person, it is just a line of code. 

*Or is it?*

If a person dies, like in San Junipero, is the body just an empty shell with no soul? Is the code that is sent to the cloud their entire person, or just a piece of it? If they die in that world, would they go to a physical, religious afterlife, or do they simply cease to exist? We see in Black Museum that the only way to implant the consciousness of another person is for them to die, but in San Junipero, that isn't the case. 

How would the various religious organizations see this technology? If you die in that world, would it really be ""you"" in San Junipero, would your soul live elsewhere, or do you just stop existing? 

I know this fan base is diverse in their beliefs, so I'd like to hear thoughts.

8577,1514874212,7nkouq,False,0,1,,False,blackmirror,Watch: What This Woman Pulled Out From Her Leg Using Tweezers Is Shockingly Relieving
8578,1514873875,7nknz2,False,13,8,"The central theme of the show as far as I can tell as always centered around technology and the subversive effects it has on ourselves and society. It usually does a great job using these subverse effects to stage situations that putt us in a moral grey area where we have to reflect on ourselves and how we would react in such situations; what that says about ourselves as people. I know that's what made me love Black Mirror and I feel safe in assuming that there are others who would agree. But every time an episode hinges of ""exporting"" a human soul into a digital copy, I want to put my head in my hands, because the episodes never truly address philosophical question behind it: is that copy of you really you? There is so much literature and thought gone into that question that it almost feels insulting to have it glossed over like this so many times. It skimps out or shies away from the real question at hand, preferring just have these digital copies set stage for far shallower questions with the answers preached at us. It's the ""Is this the Ship of Theseus?"" versus ""Is Infinitely Torturing People Bad, Durr?"" 

The closest the show ever got to this question was in I'll Be Right Back but it focused more on how the obvious copy was visibly affecting the wife rather than any agency on the copy's part. However in the latest few episodes, particularly S4E01 and S4E06, the show explicitly assumes that these digital copies are entirely sentient and effectively real copies of people, first by having Nanette in USS Callister, as nothing more than code in a server, trap and kill Meth Damon who is a living human being and second with Clayton in Black Museum, due to his gratuitious and duplicated and infinite suffering being so central to the plot. And that's really problematic for me because the show stops being about moral gray areas and just goes into ""torturing people-programs is bad, guys"". The show just tells you to accept their sentience and move on. Here is the Ship of Theseus. It's obviously all of them, what are you, stupid-- let's watch Meth Damon literally wipe the smirk off of this girl's face. Seriously, these digital processes could literally be replaced with magic, I mean full-on harry potter waving a wand, wizard magic, and the story would not change at all. Robert Daly could be a nerdy sorcerer in Skyrim soul-trapping barmaidens and making them act out his own hero story in personal pocket of the Soul Cairn and the episode would be the same. The episode is not about technology anymore, that's just an excuse to get Meth Damon to act as an asshole god and a pretty girl to figure him out while dressed as a 70s star trek homage. 

Now, the obvious question is: why not just accept it, right? If the show wants me to believe that badly that hello_world can be people, why not? There are weirder things to suspend your disbelief on.

That's the thing, though. Even starting at the premise of ""Is code, people? Yes."" there are far more interesting directions to take this concept then Meth Damon Owns a Not-Sex Dungeon or Fuck This One Guy Inifinitely Forever. And that just makes me super disappointed. Remember when I said that this technology could be replaced by magic? That's a bit of misleading wordage there, because sentient code as far as the computer science world is concerned might as well be magic. I work on machine-learning modules for a living and you would not believe how far we had to go to get our code to approach even a rudimentary level of a human's reasoning. The finest minds of the entire world can't make a program that can read and interpret any given book more accurately than two people bumping uglies, then sending whatever spawns off to whatever passes for public school. My dog is smarter in many ways than the algorithm that I'm helping to write which is supposed to recommend chemical titrations to hundreds of thousands of people.

But that's what sentient code is. It's like the FTL of the programming world. Everyone was walking around the world of USS Callister like an inifintely procedurally generated world was the greatest thing ever when Minecraft was released in 2011. Meanwhile Meth Damon complies a human soul from the lid of a coffee cup in 13 hours and the best he can do with a universe in which he is God is have the pretty girls in his office kiss him after he blows up the gym jock? IF we ever write code that as intelligent as us, the effects would be transformative. Sociology, Political Science and Economics would become hard sciences overnight. We could run simulations on tax policy and law enforcement and pick only the most optimal choices. Communists might actually have their working society because they could have the computation power of millions of the world's finest economists working together planning their economy out down to the individual level. 

Think of what Black Mirror could do with that.

Think if instead of ""Fuck This One Guy Inifinitely Forever"" like in White Christmas or Black Museum, what if they simulated a world with only the finest geniues living within, and let that run for a few millenia and see what inspirations they came up with. Or if they simulated Michelangelo actually having the time to complete his Tomb of Julius II or being threatened enough to take the Sultan up on his offer to construct a bridge, then we actually fabricated to works in real life? What there was a simulated world that took all of the serial killers' code who popped up over the years and combined that into a comprehensive profile ala Mindhunter, then used it like the future-crime reporting thing in Minority Report to preemptively handle offenders? Or if you subscribe to the idea that the code would be able to improve its own code, it would create that singularity that everyone freaks out about so much while holding phones with Siri installed, [who does shit like this](https://imgur.com/JsJZ8w4). Infinitely improving code would be a omnisicent god and it would happen as fast as the code could self-rewrite. How is that for an episode premise? A scientist writes self improving code, then races to stop it before it literally becomes God, while grappling with the morality of terminating it.

Horses, for one thing, are the underrated outdated technology imo. I grew up riding horses and to me, and to anyone who's galloped in a field or jumped a fence on these four-legged majestic creatures, they symbolize the freedom of the past before technology came biting at our ankles to keep us all in the herd. 
It amazes me that the ""ancient"" man, to me symbolizing the grandparents of our generation painted one to symbolize how his life was before parents were able to track their kids with Find my iPhone and that right before Sara went all out rebellious with experimenting with coke, drew one for Trick.
The fact that he wouldn't put it on his van, which I know he had for work, symbolizes that he could never go all out public with her because she was underage, which is a big problem with the hook-up generation nowadays.

The dog started out as a ""vicious"" looking creature, but he was chained up so I think that symbolized how they started up as wolves and now big dogs aren't good in small houses and don't get the sufficient care they need. A lot of people want big dogs as their first but have no idea how much work it is to train certain breeds if they don't do their research first. The dog started out as a blur to Sara, then all she saw when the filter was taken off was a snarling beast who looked like he wanted to attack her, but his tailed was wagging and he was still chained up and behind a fence.
After walking past him every day and seeing that maybe he was just crying out for attention the entire time, she starts to befriend him and feed him treats, just like Sara had to learn that humans have primal instincts to fuck and fight, but she had to learn the hard way that the latter of these instincts can get out of hand fast. 
I also liked the subtle hint with the mug that grandpa eventually had to drink out of when he was dying, knowing that pugs are one of the most unhealthy breeds and he had to drink out of the mug that commercializes how ""cute"" their deformed faces are, just like a first time dog owner has to eventually deal with their dog getting old and dying. 
There was also one scene with a toy shaped like a dog, which is all Sara got for a pet. As an owner of two chihuahuas, I can say certain toy breeds are probably the easiest type of dog to start out with for people who aren't good at keeping up the maintenance their dog might actually need.

8607,1514867253,7nk4n7,False,5,5,"So I binge watched Black Mirror (Starting with Season 1 and then 4,3,2 cause that's how Netflix decided to play them) and checked the subreddit for every episode I felt stood out (first Shut Up and Dance, Hated In the Nation, and now White Bear) and I saw people discussing how White Bear is a reflection of the US prison system which basically profits off of punishing criminals, or how it's a reflection of the eye for an eye mentality people have for those found guilty of crimes, or torture. 

One thing I thought immediately, that I didn't see anybody else bring up, is that it's not really revenge if the person you're getting revenge on doesn't know it. The woman had her entire memory wiped so she had no idea what was going on, she didn't even seem to understand after it was explained to her. Forgetting that it's cruel and unusual punishment, it's not even close to being justice because she doesn't understand what's happening. It defeats the whole purpose of what's going on. 

I do agree that we should be humane with prisoners and actually rehabilitate them instead of just lock them up and hope for the best, but all I could think about this episode was how this wasn't even accomplishing what they were intending to accomplish (besides making a profit) because the woman had her brain wiped clean every night.

Yeah maybe ole Charlie boy just wanted redditors to go ""hey one name, two episodes, EASTER EGG yey!"". But I'm asking why he chose Saint Juniper at all. So I looked up Saint Juniper and reading up on it I realised why.

Saint Juniper was one of Francis Of Assisi's posse and his most notable deed was the Legend of the Pig's Feet. Feel free to check it out, but essentially Juniper got talking to this dying dude who's last wish was to have some pig's feet. Juniper goes off and maims a pig for its trotters giving it to the ailing peon. The farmer was understandably pissed off, but Juniper just didn't understand why. He'd done a nice thing, why was the farmer angry?

Juniper was like this, he'd give away the group's possessions to poor people all the time to the point his pals had to hide their shit from him so he wouldn't donate it.

My point is this is reminiscent of the way a robot works. You program it to get pig's feet, it takes pig's feet. Unless you specifically tell it otherwise it would never occur to it not to steal the feet.

What makes me even more sure this is why the name Saint Juniper was used in the first place is something from Metalhead S4E5. In a fleeting moment it's mentioned the robot 'Dogs' killed all the pigs in a farm the charcters pass. Presumably this is a further nod to the legend of Saint Juniper and Brooker comparing his mentality to that of an AI.

Me reading into stuff too much? Perhaps. But we all know how smart Charlie is, we know he inserts hidden meaning into every nook and cranny he can find. So yeah, I'm pretty sure that's why that name in particular was used not once but twice. Agree, don't agree? Eh I just wanted to point it out.

Every single episode this season so far has an element of surveillance, or perhaps more accurately, intrusiveness into the most private spheres of life, within it. 

Arkangel is the most obvious, with Crocodile a close second. In Hang the DJ, the participants in the simulation are spied on to make sure they're abiding by the rules of the system, and in USS Callister, Daly only is able to ""assimilate"" people into his game by swiping their DNA--and, he's always watching them, unless of course, the game is paused. In Metalhead, the alien dogs fire implants into their victims to track them. In Black Museum, Carrie is always watching her husband (and the mom is always watching her daughter). And the inmate, in his digital form, is almost always being watched. 

Other themes seem to be neverending torture, (most obviously in Black Museum and USS Callister), but I still think the overarching one connecting them together is surveillance. Would love to hear your thoughts?",False,blackmirror,Main theme of S4? Surveillance.

8674,1514853877,7niwxj,False,20,1,"While I do not think this is the worst episode in the show, or that there is nothing to like in this episode, I have a big issue with the episode, and that is one of tone. Especially in its ending.

Throughout the episode, the characters and dialogue felt more like marvel characters, lacking any kind of convincing portrayal of how real people act in these far out situations, which is what Black Mirror does exceptionally well. Instead the main character was, after an initial moment of panic, a quipy, fun loving action star that didn't really seem affected by the gravity of the predicament.

While black mirror is great at showing how realistic everyday people can be driven into a downward spiral by technology, we start the episode with an already established 'evil' character, and then follow our flawless 'goody hero' character who outwits him in the end to escape to a content life of space adventure while he is trapped in his creation (and dies apparently?) and the show treats it as a cheerful victory.

Usually the series will show us the consequences of these kind of actions up front, but it seemed to actively avoid showing any negative consequences or side effects for the main character in this episode. Despite them being trapped in this eternal purgatory for the rest of their lives, the protagonist gives the camera a little eye brow wiggle with a smile on her face as they blast off into adventure, which doesn't feel like a real reaction to their situation. Nor is there any kind of commentary or twist really being put forward except 'bad guy is bad and deserves death. Good guys are good and are happy so hooray!'

Some interesting ideas that could have been put forward:

-What if the escaped crew discover life in the new game is even worse then in their previous hell? That everyone who plays online acts like the same as Daly? That could say something about gaming and how everybody has the potential to act like Daly when we believe there are no consequenes. 

-I'm not sure why Daly deserved to die at the end. Do I deserve to die for drowning a Sim in a pool 10 years ago? What he did was creepy but his death was not shown as a victory more so then a tragedy. His death felt very shoehorned and nonsensical to me, like the show writers felt he deserved justice when realistically, he really didn't, and the show should recognize that.

-What about the fact the real life Nanette was linked to Daly's death (as she broke into his apartment moments before his death) and had been arrested because of the actions of her cookie counter part? That kind of delicious irony is ripe for black mirror but they don't even address it (even though it is the most likely case to occur after the episode ended).

I know a lot of people say ""well not every ending needs to be a downer, there can be happy endings!"". I personally, don't see these endings as downers. They feel honest, cathartic and realistic. Black Mirror has always been an escape from the cliche, and when it ends its episode with the baddy defeated and the crew saying 'aye aye captain' as they blast into space for more adventures, does not resonate with me, as I've already seen it a dozen times.

Season 4 Episode 6 has fewer similarities to Hated in the Nation but I think it's safe to say we can make a stretch and point to the obvious similarities between BM and WC.

What I'm saying is that, obviously each of the episodes in their respective seasons are very different actual content-wise, but each episode of 4 has similar themes to its season 3 counterpart and some hit a few of the same beats. 

Metalhead could possibly be connected to MAF in some way, as MASS implants became more and more easily hacked, the military resolved to create 'dogs' that don't habour any pesky human emotions and killed the roaches ruthlessly. However, perhaps they kept killing off people they felt inferior, until they decided that all humans were inferior and they went about killing off the entire human race.

EDIT: I've had another idea about this that would explain the similarities -- the episode order plays an important part in how the episodes affect you. I watched this season out of order, leaving Black Museum til last of course, but I imagine that it was arranged to have the same affect as Season 3 did. Start with the colourful fantasy of Nosedive's pastel world of social credit and USS Callister's campy Star Trek parody and complex rules, continue with something where the tech is more experimental rather than highly developed so we get this sense of tentative discovery rather than ubiquity. Move on to a tale of morality including a sympathetic character who does bad, bad stuff so we start to question our ethics, then take a break with a love story and a happy ending, since the previous episode will have utterly destroyed you. Change the pace with something more violent and full-on, until finally ending with something deep and philosophical that leaves you wanting more (Blue being alive and hunting Scholes, Nish, her mum and Carrie all off to fuck shit up).

1. Understand your fear is real
2. Sell everything you own and afterwards completely liquidate all of your bank accounts. Don't worry about your credit score as SkyNet will kill us all the same.
3. Delete all social media accounts. If you had a MySpace, delete that too. Clear your YouTube watch and Google/Bing search histories just to be sure. Also rip out the tech console completely from your car if it was included.
4. If you need video games, go to the local back-generation video game store (ours' is Play N Trade, your city should have one not too far) and buy consoles with no access to the internet and get some games you remembered liking from your childhood. Refuse to sign up for the membership. Pay cash.
4. If you need porn, buy a VHS/DVD combo from Goodwill and look for Backpage ads of people unloading their porn collections. Magazines will work, also. Pay cash for this, too. It's OK to give the fellow human your real name as SkyNet will come installed with everyone's personal info anyway.
5. Smash all items you own with an internet connection into pieces, then collect all of the fragments, douse them in gas, burn them to ashes, bury the ashes, then dig up the earth that has the ashes, put the dirt in a bag made of ionized material and throw it in the deepest part of the largest body of water you can find. If it's the ocean, charter a boat. And yes, you're paying with cash.
6. Acquire weapons. If you live in America all you need is a a clean record and a driver's license, and the NRA also lobbied Congress to keep the CDC from getting access to the records so your footprint will be smaller than you think. And SkyNet will also know your armed, and the Terminators really won't give a shit, really.
7. Find a remote part of the wilderness and squat on it. Prepare for a life of solitude living off of the land as someone else will take the John Connor job (trust me, it doesn't have to be you and we lose either way) and no one can be trusted.
8. Good luck. And remember, survival means you're alive ...*and whatever you do*, **keep one in the gun for yourself**.

",True,blackmirror,S4E6 teaser found [spoiler]
8725,1514843895,7nhxqq,False,3,3,"I wanted to write this analysis to share to some friends, and explain why I believe the different themes and tones better suit this season when compared to the previous ones. Beginning from what I believe to be the worst to the best episode:


**Black Museum**


Although the episode had some fascinating stuff in it, somehow it ended up being quite uninspired for me. It's like a mixture of several movies that involve joy of pain and degenerating into being a psychopathic junkie. It was basically like watching several stuff taken from various films (going from American productions like American Psycho and Get Out to more hardcore Japanese movies), and see it merged together into a mishmash of a plate that contains some visible and enjoyable Black Mirror flavour, but doesn't quite get the recipe right. It ultimately falls short from being a sort of revenge story that easily becomes very predictable before the scare of the girl risking her life by being inside the Museum manages to settle in. The way the suffering and pain was portrayed, along the humane side which was realistic but kind out-of-place, made this episode the least likeable of this season for me.



**USS Callister**


I have read that for some this is the best episode of the season. For me it was a great beginning, for the reason that it brought back the familiarity of the grayish nature of humanity, along the ethical and personal issues typical of this series... without adding a horrible twist. The cast ensemble is great, and actors from big series like Breaking Bad, House of Cards and Fargo come together to collaborate into a darker show like Black Mirror, giving a big cinematic treat to add to the nostalgic/quaint/comical feeling of the Star Trek parody obfuscated by a dark shade. I think what makes it fall short later on is that it becomes too much involved into ""Nerd Fantasy"" and doesn't really explore the possibility of making Daly amend for his mistakes or becoming a better person. One key sequence for me was Walton saying he was sorry for what he had done, with the hope that Daly would try to stop them through dialogue and apologizing, and maybe bring forth an ending even darker than the one we are left with. 

I am not sure if he will be checked on by his colleagues or if someone will find out that he is left in a video game and might die in real life from starvation/dehydratation. In spite of everything I believe it was a great opener for the season, and the tone of it, which is funnier and lighter but still retaining that feeling we're used to, prepares us to enjoy the whole of the new season with the proper mindset.



**Arkangel**


This place was contested by this episode and the next one, and it's only because of minor things/impressions that I believe Arkangel gets fourth place instead of Metalhead. 
What I really liked of this episode was exploring the over-protectiveness of parents, and how technology could enter the frame as a help which could easily derange into invasion of a child's private sphere and development. What's really enjoyable for me are all the nuances in regard to a child's development and education: would a child that is exposed to violence, bad stuff, swearing and sex end up becoming more prone to be apathetic of it, exploiting it, exploring it, and so on? I believe it's important to protect a child's ""childhood"", the sense of wonder, happiness and safety that are associated with infancy. Of course it's quite difficult to settle a line, but covering everything with a censoring filter isn't a proper solution. What would be good is controlled or avoidable exposure in critical cases, but certainly it should be done with more communication between parents and children, rather than with omni-present control and manipulation from a mother. The fact her 'little girl' ends up having sex (and possibly saying things like ""Fuck me harder"" which to a parent would be denigrating, but it should be pretty normal for people to enjoy themselves however they want in bed, as long as they don't end up irremediably hurt or dying) seems to be the point where we see that she doesn't recognize her as adult. Naturally the age of consent is above 15, but it's also pretty normal for teenagers to have sexual experience nowadays; what should be allowed and whatnot is a big point of discussion in many countries. What I really didn't like was the taking of drugs, especially at that age, which does seem to make the device reliable and useful, but that's personal preference. On the opposite side we havethe fact that the mother killed an unborn baby because she deemed it was better to do so and have her little girl not go through the hardships of pregnancy from an unwanted father (unwanted from her mostly). It's a very good episode in regard to ethics and invasive technology, continuously playing with our thinking whether the use of it is ultimately good or bad while maintaining a neutral, grayish approach, a blend of bad and good, and it's important that a series like Black Mirror delves into it and has an episode with it as its focus.



**Metalhead**


Somehow this episode was refreshing. It might have been the decision to shoot it in black and white, the feelings of a strong woman trying to survive a perilous 'creature' like in Alien, and the fact that it was nice to see a fully direct 'technology vs. robots' episode for once. Taking into account the engaging last episode of Season 3, as well as the last of the current one, if the world of Black Mirror is connected through the episodes then this should be last in the timeline; of course, if it's a post-apocalyptic episode, rather than some kind of dystopia/rebellion/crazed government one. While the color choice was done taking into account the possibility of making the robots seem even more realistic, I find that it gives a monochromatic bleakness to a world that is post-apocalyptic and without the color-variety of a tranquil everyday life. The struggles she endures are very reminiscent of many sequences in which people escape rabid dogs, with the added critical factor that this dog won't stop even if it loses a limb or two or needs to wait dozens of hours. And you can be sure that if it can't get you, it will gladly let others take the burden, until the deed is done. Merit also goes to the final shot, showing that the culprit box was full of Teddy Bears. I wondered if they contained personalities like the monkeys mentioned in the last episodes, but it was probably just an unrelated nice touch of innocence into that cold, monochrome world of bleakness.



**Crocodile**


Now this is one extremely good episode. I kept wondering how the heck British people had those nice Scandinavian mountains, because I watched the episode in a rush and didn't realize it was set in Nordic countries. Nonetheless it was a great choice for what seems to open as a very bland episode and turns out to get everything right, from the feeling and pace to give to the people, to the choice of the title itself. 

Up to the point where the past comes up knocking at her door (quite literally in this case), to the eventual disposal following what predictably happens, the episode doesn't seem to give much to the viewer, and the only thing that seems to give a Black Mirror-y feeling is that cute and amiable pizza van that shows the perils of letting delivering technology be fully automatized and go unchecked, if the guy is lying of course. The episode seems to become a cover-up episode, and one wonders if the pizza van is the true mastermind behind it all. But jokes aside, that's where things really escalate: you become more interested into the way the lo-fi recaller device gets used and can potentially become the de facto arbiter for the innocence of our architect. The tension in understanding who will end up revealing her deed grows all the way to the dentist man, whilst showing how invasive technology can become, and how easily our memories can be changed. A jacket changes color just with a mention of the insurance agent, the guy itself remember the hit immediately after getting on the road, while from another point of view he is on the road basically standing and the van hits him with a delay. The insurance agent to me doesn't seem reliable: she will of course try to stick to the law, but some sentences to me appeared as her trying to get her way into people, so that she could earn the bonus. Furthermore we're not sure if the government did made mandatory signaling people that don't cooperate, because of that (of course I write ""we"", but it's mostly my own individual perception of it all). What I really get from this all is the danger of someone with means to exploit someone else from a position of justice. Meanwhile, through all of it, we're shown a family slowly becoming broken in secrecy through the act of murder, a family coming together with a birthday present and smiles is on the other side of the spectrum. It is the collision of these two worlds, of these two mothers facing different struggles and different jobs, that ends up undoing both. Mia is a surrogate of a cold-killer, intelligent and ready to do what she thinks necessary to prevent the situation from degenerating, but falling into a spiral that becomes more and more intricate, while showing how frail and barely sustaining herself she really is. I think she might have been a hardcore alcoholic, first because she drinks a beer with much eager in spite of her ex-partner saying he's sober since a while. Secondarily because of the reaction of the husband when she arrives at the school's play, so that's why I believe she had an inner strength that had merely a thin protection from the heavy frailty of her character. What cements the episode is the mixture of dark feeling given by *Shut Up and Dance* when we hear that the baby has been killed too, and the fact that the Crocodile might be one reference in the episode not simply because of it being a calculating predator with a very good memory, but because it is not the only non-human animal that posses a brain capable of being accessed by a recaller team to find out murders that end up crying tears of crocodile up to the end. We end up either striving for Mia's success or downfall, but desirous of finding a resolution, that becomes unexpected in one episode where what really shines isn't the supposed 'twisted dystopic' technology, but the human beings in it, the way their actions and use of the technology influence the whole of the story.



**Hang the DJ**


There are two episodes that I really am fond of in regard to Black Mirror: San Junipero and the very first I have seen of the series, *The Entire History of You*. Frank approaching Amy and then seeing them both approach someone else somehow immediately reminded me of the perils of a relationship that turns out to be less romantic and perfect than it immediately seems, while the whole dating/getting together in a world where technology is what seems to mostly allow these kind of interactions, in good and bad, brought to mind the former one. 

From the many references to dating app, to the way we face relationships today, I found this episode to be very realistic (in spite of the factor 'supercomputer technology'), and also quite emblematic. We tend to detach ourselves more and more by trying out relationships that seem to be better on paper, or not really thinking twice about it, never giving possibilities to certain individuals, while giving too long a time and ""chance"" to those that surely don't deserve our time, and are there just to temporarily enjoy the ride. In this case the duration of it is not entirely left to the choice of the humans, but the abandonment and compliance with technology in the hope of it bringing a result we cannot find on our own is very modern, and is one reason we often hear the ""we are more connected yet at the same time more disconnected"" mantra. 

It made me happy that the two would think of each other while being forced to be with other people, and I did strive for a rebellion myself: whenever smiles and talks and jokes and second chances happened, I mentioned that my faith in humanity was getting restored. Naturally there is a bit of bias in all of this: I struggle a lot with apathy and with thoughts of being capable of having a proper relationship again, which makes episodes like San Junipero and other media where 'true love' gets to win very likeable to me. But objectively I found this episode to be great in its own self, showing that part of the dangers of technology could be controlled to become something that puts technology back on the *useful* and *benign* sphere. We get to like the characters more and more: I personally felt immersed by reminiscing about bad situations I had, similarities I found in past attempts at a proper relationship and even conversing with other people on the matter, and got to strive for the pair to just rebel the heck out of the situation and attempt to escape this dictatorship against true love. It seems that everything falls apart when they quarrel, and the difference in the importance given to this or that problem (time vs promise) is also quite evocative of typical human relationships, and it's that humane side shown when they abandon technology through what they learned from each other (*""Count to four""*) that prevails against it all. The nice touch of it all is that the simulation we see ends up being number 998, referring to the 99,8% rebellion percentage in each simulation, which is taken as the *ultimate match* for the pair. 
All said and done, the pair never really met from what we're shown, and we don't even know if the personalities and people we saw are really the same two people that smile to each other at the end. There is uncertainty, you end up thinking *""Oh no, they won't end up together, the doubts are there and they're not convinced!""*, but technology isn't to be underestimated, and they know the chances given are to be taken. And in spite of the spectre of it controlling our decisions, the benign utility it can offer and the uplifting ending that is also contained in it is what seals this episode of Black Mirror as the best one for me, showing the potential of a series that doesn't have to resort to petty revenges and the usual darker twist to impress its audience once again with another trite dark facet of the future. Being able to show humanity in a show where technology, cold detachment and twisted results seems to be the central theme gives in my opinion a better closure that the sixth episode doesn't really deliver, making me desirous to see what season 5 will bring to us by exploring more and more the what's to come of our own society and the way we relate to new technologies along their offers of new, previously unused possibilities.

I guess everybody here already have fallen in love, have experienced a relationship or have deeply liked someone.

They have truly found the person that is going to be the best companion for life, the one person you would fight for. The one person you would 99,8% of the time break the system.

But I know, I know this 99,8% person  exists, and she is out there, probably living with someone else, enjoying life day after day with someone good, but not 99,8%, not me.

But I have a good person with me, I had good moments with her, and for the sake of our past memories I enjoy our passing days. 

It’s just sad to think that I am never meeting mine 99,8%. 

This episode has shown me what I will never have, he has shown that with such a system you could have found that person, but when the episode ends, you just have to look at the person you have for now and try to deal with it.

8747,1514838321,7nhcyl,False,0,2,"I really enjoyed this episode- I thought it was outrageously smart, incredibly funny, and it had a good amount of depth in terms of characters and thematic issues.  

However, I really found myself struggling to care much about the major characters- the digital copies, or the “sentient code”, a phrase used by a character to self-identify at one point.  

I had a hard time buying in to the idea that these were conscious, sentient “beings”. The story and the world in which it was set did not successfully reach out and grab me and cause me to suspend my suspicion or disbelief. The most high-tech things we see in this episode are an immersive VR game, and a fancy digital-display apartment door... I had no reason to believe that AI tech had advanced in this world to the extent that the show wanted me to or required me to, that programming had reached such a height as to create sentient, conscious “beings” worthy of my moral care and concern.  The characters were just literal gaming NPCs- an idea which made for some intriguing and fun entertainment, but which failed to grab me on an emotional level like the show seemed
to be attempting.  So I had a hard time caring about these characters and their fates.  (I understand that it is a huge open question right now in philosophy of mind and in debates centered around AI as to whether a program or a sequence of code can ever be considered conscious or sentient, about whether AI programs will ever reach a point at which they will be deemed “worthy” of something like basic human rights or ethical considerations, etc... and I think the fact that I even feel compelled to post this discussion about these characters being “just” code says something about the success of this episode and it’s themes... It is interesting to consider the question about what should be considered living, conscious, sentient, aware... are 0’s and 1’s really all that different, ultimately, from biological neurons either firing or not firing? If a program can perform the same *functions* as a human, then should it be considered truly conscious? At what point does syntax (code) give rise to semantics (meaning)- or can it, or is there more required? What is required for an entity to be considered as having self-awareness?)

What I did find myself caring about, though, were the ethical concerns centered around the human character of Daley.  If the subjects of his torture were truly just bits of code, programmed clones, gaming NPCs, then at the surface it seems that it would *not* be unethical for him to torture and rule over them as a malevolent deity. However, what is interesting ethically is what this behavior and mindset would do to *Daley’s humanity*. It is my belief that such destructive behavior would eat away at one’s humanity, one’s sense of self, and one’s ability to be ethical in the real world of flesh-and-blood human beings. To me, that is the primary theme of this episode. It is an interesting thought that, in the end, the fate that Daley suffered was truly caused *by his own actions*, that he bore in himself the fruit of his destructive behavior, that he truly did end up losing his humanity by his own hand.  Yes, the NPCs were the agents, but we can take the perspective that they were only acting in response to his actions and in the parameters he had programmed into them. By being inhumane, even to non-human entities, Daley brought about his own destruction.

It just didn’t seem remarkable to me that Mia would be found out. It’s an expected direction IMO that the memory recaller thing would have caught up to her in one way or another. And even if she had killed all witnesses (not forgotten the guinea pig), it isn’t like she would have gotten away with it that easily. Murderers have been found with less and I imagine forensic science would be even more advanced then. Mia left behind messy crime scenes, murder weapons and bodies that just needed to be recovered. It wasn’t a total secret that the insurance woman was looking for her since she was asking the hotel clerk about Mia (the last or one of the last times she was seen in public). Once the disappearance of any of the family members was realized, investigators could have pretty easily been led to Mia, making her a suspect, esp with the use of the memory recaller.

That the memory recaller is powerful and valuable in an investigation just seems... obvious. Too obvious. 

I wasn’t rooting for Mia, but the whole time I was still thinking (hoping) the “twist” would be that Mia gets away with it, showing the fallibility of the memory recall technology in spite of how airtight and reliable it seems, with Mia representing the evolved—or just extremely lucky—serial killer of the future exploiting whatever loophole *must* exist. I’m also curious to see how this angle would be played by a highly competent defense team in the legal system. That would’ve been *really* dark and way more interesting to me. I was disappointed that this episode didn’t go down that direction since it’s not one that Black Mirror has explored (I think).

8873,1514797549,7neafy,False,75,25,"Im actually in disbelief at how bad this was.

The protagonist becomes ted bundy in the span of 10 minutes when the ex says he is going to confess. He doesn't even plan to disclose her presence, she was not even the actual killer, yet somehow this otherwise succesful married woman is capable to eliminate all obstacles right down to child murder, like a fucking terminator. All she has to show for it is a few crocodile tears.

She ties down this investigator like a terrorist and murders her in cold blood right after seeing her husband. 

This innocent woman is about to be killed and she doesn't think of the most important thing in her life: her son/daughter. You'd think she would be screaming ""PLEASE I HAVE A CHILD DONT KILL ME"" but no, that would ruin the ending.

Initially when she tried to escape, her car doesn't start. How fucking convenient and unnecessary. We see our brainless little blonde protagonist break the window with a rock and drag an innocent woman out like a petite ed fuckin' kemper.

In all television you have to suspend disbelief, I know this. This episode requires you to eliminate believability from your brain a concept to work.

The twist at the end is meh, like I dont even care about what happens to this woman, she is literally on the same level as jeoffrey baratheon for me, a cartoonishly despicable ""human being"".

And dont get me started on interviewing the goddamn chinchilla for its memories..

Basically you have a protagonist that is the worst person ever, doing increasingly more violent things in the dumbest way possible, and an ending that tries to be good old black mirror by piling on the misery brainlessly. I hate that the one episode thus far that tries to be as bleak as possible is THIS bad.",False,blackmirror,[S4E3] This is by far the worst episode of the entire series in my opinion.

Most endings of Black Mirror aren't happy, and you feel for the people they happen to. Brooker really goes all-in with this on Metalhead, as Hang the DJ was a happy ending and awesome twist. But a lot of really bad people got what was coming to them.

USS Callister - Daly is an asshole. At the beginning you feel for him and think he's just playing out a fantasy to break away from reality, and then you find out he's a complete piece of shit. F--- him.

Arkangel - Mom initially loads the chip meaning well, a justified thought seeing as parents want what is best for their children, but she snooped into her daughter's intimate life and slipped Sara the Plan B pill, and Mom's desire to shield her child completely from violence caused Sara's teenage self to nearly beat Mom to death with the iPad. Jordan Peterson would have called it.

Crocodile - Murdering the adults to protect your success I get, although it is still wrong, but no one (self included) can have sympathy for someone that murders a child. Turns out they got it from the guinea pig. I had a verbal reaction to that.

The Black Museum - Ethics can get in the way of the kind of ""research"" Rolo was handling, but to subject weather girl murderer Clayton's consciousness to endless torture just to put him in another cell to make money and lie about giving the money to his family? That guy had it coming.

Also the concept of the cookie is handled heavy in USS Callister, Hang the DJ and The Black Museum, which is a special episode in that it demonstrated the guinea pigs that have to suffer while new tech ""irons out the wrinkles"". I'll pass for signing up for any of that shit.

Spoilers for White Bear and White Christmas

There are a lot of good messages in Black Mirror and although the show is well done and there are great episodes, some are too far fetched in my opinion. 

It all starts with White Bear. White Bear has two  messages. One is about entertainment and the other is about criminal punishment. The message about entertainment, in my opinion, should have been the only message because the other one seemed almost impossible. 

You really think everyone would be okay with torturing a murderer? I mean I know I know maybe in the foreseeable future but that environment didn't seem that advanced. It almost seemed like our environment. I mean what you're showing is a totally different group of people. Of course we like watching maybe wrestling but you really think all the country would be on board with torturing a girl for eternity? I mean saying this is like saying maybe in the future we could turn into monkeys because their tails are useful but oh no we lose emotions now cause we're monkeys. It's so far beyond humanity. Maybe it could happen but I'm not convinced so I really need help to understand.

Now White Christmas. I loved this episode and it was a great story but I don't think it was told well. The thing is this episodes leaves too many questions. Why would they give emotions to something they could just leave as AI? Does no one know that they have slaves and if so do they reject it like they don't exist like the China workers who barely get paid anything? What did the guy dying in the beginning have anything with technology? Wasn't it all about the girl's insanity? It felt like a good story but I don't see what it was pushing at all. Was it to not let someone command and tell you what to do whilst at a Christmas party so that when you speak to them, girls that are insane think you have voices in your head and thay you need death? What benefits would there be to blocking? Wouldn't blocking give more problems than solutions? Couldn't you just avoid a person easily enough and isn't blocking even more rude than abruptly leaving? Could you just block police men or your parents? Why the heck would blocking be implemented?

I guess from all these questions here's what I can conclude are my problems. The first story seems unnecessary and without a good message. The second story brings up so many questions that could be explored and could actually make it so it affects us personally. If anything, at the end of that, I didn't feel like I could do anything about it but say, ""Well it's the government and the rich people."" I mean how could the original lady know about her slave? How can I stop it and find out the difference between a robot and a slave? Those are better questions that would actually affect the audience that is watching. The third story, it seems improbably because it doesn't give a reason for the addition of the block feature. It isn't obvious and I sure didn't get it. Sure I uunderstand for Facebook but on Facebook that is a whole world where people can come in anonymously and without a face and write stupid stuff. In real life, blocking brings way more problems and I don't care if catcalling can be a little rude, how could anybody think that's a good idea?

Well please prove me wrong. ",False,blackmirror,I think two of the episodes' messages aren't well used and almost unbelievable.

8936,1514778653,7nd2fm,False,2,8,"So I was watching Black Museum and saw Jack (the father in the second story) reading 15 Million Merits in graphic novel form, and it raised the question as to whether Black Mirror has a ""real"" universe and a ""fictional"" universe for their more outlandish plots. I've seen a timeline of the whole series and I'm wondering whether or not the episodes that aren't referenced in Haynes' museum are either part of the fake universe. Some episodes wouldn't make sense to be included in the museum, and could reasonably be considered something that had happened within the Black Mirror Universe A.

Here are the episodes that aren't showcased in Rolo Haynes' Black Museum:

Fifteen Million Merits (Graphic Novel) F

The Entire History of You (Real if we assume that this is a predecessor to White Christmas, which is also real) R

Be Right Back (Probably real, the cookie technology isn't perfect yet explains the tech. This could be comfortably set in the real universe) R&gt;&gt;F

The Waldo Moment (Probably real, nothing tells me that it can't happen in the real universe, and more importantly, did happen in another fictional universe) R&gt;&gt;&gt;F

White Christmas (Introduces cookies, which are very much real in this universe) R

Nosedive (Probably real since it includes a reference to Michael Callow, entire incident feasibly doesn't belong in the museum, so this is likely real) R

Shut Up and Dance (The rats in the first story are named Kenny and Hector. Could be a nod from the writers, or it could be an in real life nod to a fictional work about the two characters. One of the more adventure-oriented plots, so this could very well be a book or a movie) F&gt;R

San Junipero (Could be real, could be a love story. If we assume that anything that doesn't have any real evidence pointing either way should be real) R&gt;F

Men Against Fire (Could be a real-world implementation of MASS tech, but could also be something in the vein of a gritty piece of anti-war fiction. The concept of war doesn't really come up very much in Black Mirror, so this is jarring to me. Perhaps it's a response to the MASS tech being developed?) F=R 

Hang the DJ (This is probably real, I don't see why not. If you've seen the episode, then you know why there isn't a reason for this not to be real, but I don't want to get into spoiler territory. I'll use Occam's Razor here and assume it's real) R&gt;&gt;&gt;F

Metalhead (Could be far into the future, but it could also be some piece of fiction like Mad Max, a post-apocalyptic book or something. A lack of an authority figure existing is pretty different for Black Mirror's cold, controlling vibe, and I doubt that the machines would plan to destroy the society) F&gt;&gt;R

F = Probability of the episode being set in a fictional world within the universe of Black Mirror

R = Probability of the episode being real within the universe of Black Mirror

8963,1514774217,7ncqjk,False,4,3,"First of all I'm a huge fan and super hyped that we have new content to watch! My fiancé and I have anxiously awaited this season and have watched an episode every night. Overall, I'm feeling like this season so far has been very weak compared to the others. I've read reviews and it's getting the usual praise, and for the first time I'm kind of baffled as to why.

Episode 1 was awesome, and I have only nice things to say. 

Episode 2 was just lazy writing in my opinion. I didn't like the mom or daughter enough to care about them. I feel like everything that happened was so pointless, and the entire plot could have been avoided with a sit down.I thought the technology was kind of ridiculous, too. Mostly my issue was not liking the characters because I couldn't understand why they just couldn't communicate like a real mother-daughter. That and the mom continually let her kid go further and further.  Weed, sex, cocaine...what?! What's the point of spying if you don't intervene? 

My biggest gripe so far is with episode 3. Like how the hell do they get the memory out of the animal? And further, why not check the GPS system of the driverless pizza car to see how fast it was going? Seems like a lousy cop out after all the build up. A guinea pig, really? I get so invested and curious as to where this is going and that's what gives her murder away? That would never happen in a Hitchcock film. 

Anyways, these are just my opinions. I enjoy discussing art with people and just want to hear yours. Am I the only one that thinks episode 2 and 3 are kind of weak compared to the others? This season feels like a miss so far, with the exception of episode 1. I hope the rest is a little better. Once again, just my 2 cents. Happy New Year!

I can't connect both episodes, but since we see reoccurring Hot Shot stuff through the show, the 15 Million Credits thing can't be in the ultra far future (that would be MetalHead), so I think that some ""Roaches"" are being sent to those camps to generate power and money for corporations.

The first successful hit was easiest, and that was the Accent Furniture Warehouse. You can see that the producers used the actual docking yard from the store in their scenes.

Finally, this is the location that started my hunt. It took me the most time, and I ended up finding it on a hunch. I knew it wasn't Toronto because of the colour of street posts/fire hydrant, so I stuck to the burbs. I couldn't clearly read the street sign, it looked like Douglas Rd., so unfortunately I spent a lot of time looking for a Rd. when it was an Ave. Anyways, this is the house with the barking dog.

It was a real feel good episode that was basically a cheesy romantic drama that catered to fans of San Junipero.

Cheesy and predictable are 2 things no Black Mirror episode should be.

San Junipero is at least redeemable in that it deals with topics like gay rights, the right to die (euthanasia) and the possibility of a real heaven that can be experienced compared to a theoretical heaven and the value of both.

This episode only made commentary on how shallow modern dating is, which is an easy and (ironically enough) shallow commentary to make in the first place.

However, I don't necessarily agree with this statement. First, a lot of previous Black Mirror episodes were fairly predictable (Men Against Fire, NoseDive, Entire History of You) and I didn't see these getting hated on as much as ArkAngel and Crocodile. Second, I would argue having a couple of predictable episodes isn't horrible, as long as the acting along the predictable story is well-done and the story is well told. We knew her rank in NoseDive would continue to drop, but seeing her reaction to it happening is what made it entertaining. Similarly, we knew the mother would continue to be overprotective in ArkAngel, but seeing just how far she is willing to go and the Mother/Daughter arguments were the entertainment value. And third (and this is likely just me), but I'm not a huge fan of the 'random' end twists anyway that we saw in Playtest.

When they originally download the app that the creators reveal at the end to us, they would exactly know, how the algorhytm and the accuracy-meter works. In this real world, they're acually both with someone, and in spite of seeing the 99.8 percent accuracy on their phones to that unknown person, (and understanding fully, how precise of a data it actually is), they choose to stay with that other person, let's say X out of 1000 times (oh, I forgot to mention, that it is also a simulation, inside a simulation). If X is bigger than let's say 950, they stood the test of loyalty to that person they choose not to leave.

I would like this ending more than the original, because it would also reflect my wordview: there is ALWAYS someone better for us out there (that's why in the original plot there was 'only' a 99.8% accuracy), and that's completely okay. We just have to learn to appreciate the person who we are with at the moment to the best of our capabilities.

I've come up with a lot of ideas for episodes, but I've tried to reduce it to the six that make the best season composition.  I hope you enjoy my ideas; I'd love to see your thoughts on them as well as your own ideas!

* ""Back Door"": In a future where everyone has extremely versatile brain implants as a matter of course, a man pirates a VR game using a shady torrent and is infected with a nasty virus that gradually worsens as it infects him with more and more malware.  This manifests as behavior changes; he compulsively recommends products to his friends and family, he tries to push sex partners to open an unsecured brain-to-brain connection with him, and he tires more easily as his subconscious is hijacked for processing cycles.  He ultimately checks into a hospital, where he's treated with very little sympathy due to the risky behavior that got him infected in the first place; he is ultimately deemed terminal due to irreversible brain damage.
* ""Flyswatter"": A modern-day story, like Shut Up And Dance: a feud between two teenage internet personalities turns deadly when one of them calls in a SWAT team on the other, claiming that there's a terror cell working out of his house and that they're building a bomb in the basement.  The team go into the incident fully believing that the report is real, and also fully intending to kill everyone in the house.  They commit various horrific abuses in the process even after it becomes very clear that they were misled, and are only caught doing so because one of them fucked up and left their body camera on.  Due to jury bias, all of the officers involved are let off despite the overwhelming evidence of brutality, but at least the hoaxer is charged and convicted as an adult, with numerous counts of first-degree murder.
* ""Terrestrial Submarine"": A story set in a future where self-driving cars have become the norm, to the point that people don't feel the need to specify that they're self-driving when talking about them.  Our protagonist is a young woman who's been in and out of mental hospitals; she's afraid of cars despite the insistence of everyone around her that they're completely safe, so she insists on walking or sometimes biking from place to place.  In a series of flashbacks that comprise the majority of the episode, we learn that when she was a small child, she took a long cross-country road trip with her aging father, when he had a stroke and died.  As a child, she had no ability to override the car's course to stop for food, lodging, or to get help, so she had to sit with her father's dead body for multiple days of travel, trying and failing to attract attention from other passengers by banging on the windows, until finally she arrived at her extended family's house where they discovered that she had been forced to eat parts of him to survive.  In the present day, the woman finds the car (or at least a car of the same model) in a used car lot, and she vandalizes it with a baseball bat; the police step in and she is recommitted, thrown into a police car that also doesn't need a human to attend to her.
* ""Whatever Happened To Humankind?"": A child star who knows she's already past her peak tries and fails to remain relevant in a future where realistic CGI ""celebrities"" who are literally designed by committee are steadily pushing their human equivalents out of the entertainment industry.  She has several public meltdowns where she curses and rants about how she's becoming obsolete, which only hastens the decline of her popularity.  We gradually learn that the reason she's so desperate to remain in the public eye is that all of the adults around her are abusing her, and as she sees it, once her career is over, that'll be all that's left for her.  But ultimately her career would have ended eventually anyway; we're ultimately meant to see the CGI idols as a good thing.  The reason they outcompete their human predecessors, the reason they don't lash out or burn out is that they don't feel or suffer in the first place, so their rise means that no one will undergo the protagonist's ordeal in the future.  It sucks to have your job automated away, but ultimately that leads to the elimination of methods of exploitation associated with your job.
* ""Comment Factory"": An episode where most of the spoken dialogue is in a foreign language, though it is subtitled in English and a lot of the episode's content is in English text.  The episode is set in a third-world slave labor camp where people with sufficient fluency in English are made to work inhumane hours at computer terminals astroturfing popular support for various corporations and individuals.  Their posts are regularly randomly audited by supervisors; they are beaten if their spam is too obviously faked, and they are killed if they try to call attention to their situation.  A romance blossoms between two of the laborers, and they escape the camp together, pursued by the armed militants who run the camp.  They get away in the end, but most of the others are killed as a form of collective punishment, as they are considered replaceable.
* ""Grey Lady"": An anthology episode set in a futuristic evangelical church of ambiguous denomination; it's implicit in the episode that in the time it's set, religion has gone from a society-dominating force to a collection of obscure subcultures.  It gradually becomes clear over the course of the episode that few of the attendants have human bodies; most of them are synthesized mechanical people who actually live in the church.  In the first story, a pervert commissions a sex robot that looks and acts like his sister.  He tries to hide it when he has visitors, but ultimately fails and gets disowned.  The robot, meanwhile, has acquired enough individuality to run away in the aftermath of this and seek a religious conversion to grow past the circumstances of her creation.  In the second story, a pair of twins are given a wireless connection between their brains at a young age and develop as a single consciousness spread across two bodies.  One of them is killed by an obsessive ex-boyfriend, giving the remaining half serious bodily dysmorphia which she solves by commissioning a robot to serve as a ""prosthetic twin"" for her.  She gets a discount if she agrees to connect to half a dozen robots rather than one, as an experiment.  She winds up liking the extra utility that comes with having seven of herself, and she winds up becoming a large fraction of her church choir.  In the third story, a charismatic preacher employs cultlike tactics, demanding his followers subscribe to a program that blocks out all outsiders (a la White Christmas).  Sure enough, he's a serial abuser who holds the threat of mass-blocking over victims' heads as a means of coercion.  His methods weren't quite watertight, though, and eventually it leaks out to the flock as a whole what's happening, and he's quickly shunned himself and thrown in prison.  The church feels deeply betrayed, and winds up creating a robotic version of their preacher, designed to actually be the man he publicly presented himself as; as an organization they decide to focus on being a place for victims to find a home alongside former monsters who can be literally made to repent of their original versions' crimes.",False,blackmirror,Pitch a Black Mirror season!

There was no trait that set any of the secondary characters apart. This all melded together to a collective cast that really didn't offer much. I don't have any real empathetic connection to any of the victims because we don't connect with them, at all. 

In short, in comparison to previous seasons this episode, from my perspective, was bad.

Arkangel was one of the most predictable, cliche filled stories I have seen in the series. You can predict the entire plot from the second she walks into the Arkangel office. From there, it is all predictable events and forgetful characters (again).

Imagine that, she checked when she was having sex. Shocker, they peeped on her doing drugs. Incredible, the device can detect if she is pregnant. And how about that, the parent checks of the ""cliche"" boxes by being overbearing and takes it out on the boy friend. I can't get passed it. Every event from the opened two scenes could accurately predicted by even the most shallow viewers.

I am hoping the rest of the episodes bring more of what I have come to expect. Suspense, twists, a bit more character depth, and a message that isn't forced and over the top.

___

**This is how I would improve an almost perfect episode.**
---

First Change is around the 30 minute mark... the ""update patch wormhole"". 

**I hate this idea**.

There's no good reason for his highly illegal private server to be connected to the internet and especially the main game servers. Having the patch expressed as a wormhole is silly too. Very 90s, needlessly flashy and dumbed down people noone in the 90s understood hacking or anything to do with computers.  I dislike the whole thing.

---

I do not like the ""calling out"" - I would especially get rid of the first instance of virtual Cole messaging IRL Cole. For someone so smart, her message was so stupid.

@ 37:17

&gt;""Robert said: HELP! MANY PEOPLE TRAPPED INSIDE INFINITY ON DALY'S COMPUTER. CONTACT CYBER POLICE""

Virtual Cole only just found out about the possibility of a person's real consciousness being put in *Infinity*, the message is meaningless to IRL Cole. It offers no evidence or information that wouldn't be dismissed as spam or a hack or whatever. 

Wouldn't a smart person's message be something like:

&gt;""Listen: this is a copy of your consciousness, I'm trapped in Robert's home server. To prove it's really you I'm going to tell this personal, private, bit of info you never told anyone.""

I understand that you couldn't just end the episode there, or highjack the flow by having her actually discover the truth... just cut it. Don't let people message out.

Have Cole hack and try... but show the message going right to junk mail, or being flagged as spam automatically. Something.

---

The actual plan they come up with is good... with a few tweaks.

I like the blackmail. 

I like using the ""pause"".

But even with the DNA backup (in his fridge) stolen that's no guarantee he doesn't have a backup of the whole thing somewhere. A programmer as brilliant as Daly must have learned to back up, version control, etc.

In my version the option of ""calling out"" is gone. So cut that. The wormhole update patch is gone too, so no race through the asteroid field. Silly. Instead of taking a shuttle he couldn't exit the game or do something. The onicorder is good, but realistically he must have some alternate means of control (similar to him holding out his hand) which allows him to leave the game or respawn back to his ship.

Using the ""omnicorder"" in general, that's fine. That could work.

I mean, realistically he would password protect it, or only allow people with ""admin rights"" within the game to access it... but fine... she works with the Infinity code all day, she might know some hacks, or know how to authorize herself. OK, great. Use the recorder.

... but don't use it for piloting to the wormhole. 

Go back and make the sequence this:
==
Cole is sitting, freaking out, **she doesn't see a wormhole**, she's just staring into the void of space and comes to the realization that she has to fight back; no matter the cost.

**The plan is:**

1. Distract the Captain
1. Steal onmicorder
1. Use onmicorder to order a pizza (sort of [like the /pizza command that was in EveryQuest](https://web.archive.org/web/20050303060338/http://everquest2.station.sony.com/pizza/))
1. While the captain is ""paused"" remove his admin rights (hacky hacky)

That way when the Robert returns he's trapped and without his powers. The simulation is still active but they're all equals.

Cut to the bridge.

Walton (Jimmi Simpson) is back in the CEO chair, with Tommy by his side (in a kind of /u/Wil Wheaton type role).

They are all shown treating Robert like they did in the real world. 

His fantasy is destroyed. 

His escape becomes his prison. The prisoners are now the guards... and the warden is everyone's bitch.

---

You could end it there or show Robert dying of dehydration over the winterbreak.

&gt;""If you stop eating and drinking, death can occur as early as a few days, though for most people, approximately ten days is the norm. In rare instances, the process can take as long as several weeks.""

A two week break is 14 days, odds are that out of shape bastard would be dead before anyone would find him. 

You could have that scene if you wanted.

---

The main point I'm getting at is remove parts that either don't make sense, make the characters look stupid, and remove the happy ending.
==
The simulated people are fucked, true... but they fucked Robert **more**. They took away his power and destroyed his fantasy.

Lead singer Morrissey “considered the song's appearance on daytime British radio a ""tiny revolution"" in its own way, as it aired amongst the very music it criticised.” [wikipedia].  

So the parallel to dating culture emerges very naturally. Like the misused pop music scene, online dating apps have “nothing to do with [the users] life” like the song alleges and are as vapid and shallow as the pop music industry. But the fight against that wasnt by tearing down the entire system. In fact music is a great institution, just as the idea of finding matches online is a good idea. So use the system to make it better: perhaps things like Tinder are trash and need to be burned, but a system like tinder with some actual thought and purpose behind it, that accurately does have something to do with the users life, would be a great thing for future daters in this world.",True,blackmirror,Insights to Hang the DJ title meaning [spoilers]

Her sister has passed away, but they have her consciousness on one of those little things you put on the side of your head. I believe that the kid was now dying, because at the beginning they mention how this ""wont save him"" but it might make his last days more enjoyable. I believe the teddy bears they are going for are the special ones you can upload a person too, and they  want to upload her sisters consciousness into it so the little boy has a little more comfort for his last days on earth.

These are episodes where most people agree that, whilst enjoyable to watch and usually by no means bad, are underdeveloped in comparison to most other episodes. However, that makes them great for introducing the series to newcomers.

S3E1 Nosedive

S4E2 Arkangel

**The Anthologies**

Any episode where the main story is split up into a few loosely related chunks. You know the drill.

S2E4 White Christmas

S4E6 Black Museum

**The Experiments**

These are episodes that stick out as odd even by Black Mirror standards. Regardless of whether the gamble pays off, these episodes represent the sort of TV you wouldn't find broadcast anywhere else. 

S1E1 The National Anthem

S2E3 The Waldo Moment

S3E2 Playtest

S4E1 USS Callister

**The Thrillers**

You thought the real world was bad? These episodes suggest a truly bleak future - either for all of us or just the characters they follow. Whilst not always horror based, Thrillers usually rely on getting us to empathise with their characters before pulling the rug out from under them.

S2E2 White Bear

S3E3 Shut Up and Dance

S3E5 Men Against Fire

S4E3 Crocodile

S4E5 Metalhead

**The Heartbreakers**

These are the love stories not even Charlie Brooker can bear to give a sad ending (well, most of the time anyway). Romance is a central plot point between the main characters, with technology being used to encourage (or hinder) their relationship.

Stuck forever in that one perfect moment of agony. Always on. Always suffering""

He makes it quite clear that these are real copies of Claytons mind, earlier on he also talks about how popular the attraction was so it's probably safe to assume there is thousands of these souvenirs still around.

After Nish transfers Rolo's consciousness to her fathers virtual one and kills them both she claims her own souvenir of Rolo's consciousness in perpetual suffering. Nish (and her mother) seem quite pleased, but wouldn't the Rolo souviner hanging on her rear mirror just be a constant reminder of how there is possibly thousands of copies of her fathers mind still suffering?

I might be missing something here but just ending the suffering of the initial copy of her father shouldn't really offer any closure when there are thousands of copies of his mind arguably in an even worse position (constant pain as opposed to occasional suffering when tourists visit).

9156,1514738096,7n9e5t,False,13,36,"Okay spoiler warning for the ending of Hang The DJ.

So I like the happy ending and this episode is probably my second favorite of the season, but I’ve been thinking about other potential endings that I think could have been a little darker.

One I’ve been thinking about a lot is, what if the episode is the same but instead of there being 998 rebellions there are only like 215, so the app says 21.5% match in the end. Then Amy looks disappointed and tries it with another person.

This implies the app is obviously different from a future tinder, but I think could be a more depressing ending not only because the Amy and Frank we saw who were in love just disappear forever with their real selves never meeting up, but also because it means this app doesn’t always get it right the first try and this happens to millions of virtual reality couples.

9161,1514737040,7n9agu,False,31,82,"I don't know if this has been discussed, but here it goes: 

This episode, beyond the standard cautionary tale of weaponized AI-run-amok, seems to make some poignant observations about the future of class warfare, society, and crime/punishment - 

To me, the background of the episode seems a lot more developed than people are giving it credit for: it seems that these Dog-Bots are basically security/police systems - one was camped out protecting a warehouse full of stuff and the rich person's home specifically had slots in the front gate and front door panels designed to grant the dogs access to the residence. So they seem basically like they were designed as the police force for the rich to keep the poor people contained. 

So it doesn't seem hard to envision this as a world where income inequality and job automation has lead to a *very* clear world of have and have-nots, in some ways paralleling what some people think have or very soon will happen. Without the advent of AI, those forces are somewhat kept in check by the fact that the poor massively outnumber the rich, but once automation and robotics have reached a point that they can effectively ""control"" the masses, then that's the world that you can very easily wind up having in this episode. 

It even plays out well as an allegory of current notions of criminal justice, police shootings and over-militarization of the police with the reveal at the end that what was being stolen was a teddy bear - that theft resulted in a completely disproportionate level of response by the ""police"". And if there are any linkages to ""white bear"" in the episode due to that very specific reference, the entire point of white bear was society inappropriately reveling in over-punishment of crime (which we tend to do nowadays as well). 

Lastly, filming it in B&amp;W also makes it ""seem"" apocalyptic, which it objectively wasn't but *was* from the perspective of the ""raiders"" in the episode.

Anyways, that's my take on it. Thoughts?

(I think the dead rich people in the house can be written off as just a murder/suicide for no special reason, and probably as a bit of a red herring to make it seem like the Dog-Bots had completely taken over, when in fact they hadn't - considering that the house wasn't in bad shape, water was still running, and the car looked relatively new, etc.)",True,blackmirror,[SPOILERS S04E05 - Metalhead] I think the social commentary and plot background are actually very well developed

Some references I spotted were the DNA scanning machine from E01, the Infinity game device to transfer your conscience to another world.

Black Museum could have been the past of USS Callister, the backstory we all want for Metalhead, the mind behind Arkangel. (Crocodile was shit, excluding that despite the bathtub ref xD)

9199,1514728345,7n8k9u,False,3,1,"As a whole, I enjoyed season 4. But after watching all six episodes I felt like something was different about this season, and it took me a while to figure out what. But after giving it more thought I've definitely pinpointed what has me so bothered.

To me, Black Mirror has been one of my favorite shows not only due to the interesting fictional technology, but also because of its morally gray characters and situations that really make you think afterwards. Almost every episode from seasons 1-3 dealt with a protagonist who does what we consider ""bad"" things, but the way they are portrayed in the episode still makes us sympathize with them. White Bear and Shut Up and Dance are the two best examples of this, but it's still present in just about every episode. They make us question ourselves and make us wonder if we really should have been rooting for people who have done such morally objectionable things. The prime minister in National Anthem, Liam in TEHOY, Matt in White Christmas... the list goes on and on.

And even in the episodes where a morally gray character isn't as prominent, the theme of technology being used and/or abused by humanity is the driving force of the show. It's basically the main theme of Black Mirror. Most episodes in the past have been so thought-provoking that I needed to wait at least several hours to a day before starting another one. With season 4, I watched three episodes back-to-back-to-back without stopping, and finished the whole season within 24 hours.

So I think that's why I was ultimately disappointed with season 4, because the episodes lacked morally gray characters and situations that really sit in my head and make me think about society as a whole. Let me run through each episode:

USS Callister - The episode starts with Daly being a somewhat sympathetic character since he's sort of a loser and treated poorly at work, but then it's established pretty early in the episode that he's actually just a massive dick who likes torturing digital copies of his coworkers, and the whole rest of the episode focuses on defeating him. Not saying it's a bad episode, it just felt like too much of a ""good vs. evil"" plot for Black Mirror. I like the dark idea of NPCs in video games being conscious, but that wasn't really the main focus of the episode.

Arkangel - This one maybe had some moral ambiguity to it, but it's hard not to ultimately see the mom as the bad guy here for being so controlling over her daughter's life. I feel like there could have been more nuance to this episode, though I guess that would've been hard considering how inherently terrible of an idea the Arkangel technology is.

Crocodile - This is probably one of my least favorite Black Mirror episodes ever, because it just didn't have anything to say. Mia was very quickly established as a cold-blooded killing machine and just became even more deranged as the episode went on. Nothing about her character made me sympathize with her, and I think the episode would've been a lot stronger if she was made out to be more like a Kenny or Victoria, someone who does terrible things but we still kind of root for them. The fact that she killed a blind infant at the end was just too unnecessarily dark for me, and the whole episode felt bleak for the sake of being bleak. (And as an aside: the technology in this episode is pretty ridiculous, because it assumes that everyone - even a fucking guinea pig - has a photographic enough memory to perfectly identify faces)

Hang the DJ - This one I didn't actually have any issues with and it's one of my favorite Black Mirror episodes. It wasn't your ""typical"" Black Mirror episode, but it was a really strong story with really strong characters, just like San Junipero.

Metalhead - This one was filmed well and was tense all the way throughout, and it was definitely unlike any other Black Mirror episode, so I give it props for that. But again, it just didn't feel like it had anything to say. I know the complete lack of context and backstory was intentional, but it didn't work. I think we needed more information to really feel invested, but by the end I was just left thinking, ""what was the point?""

Black Museum - Again, we find out pretty early on that Rolo is a creep, and he's just revealed to be more and more evil as the episode goes on. This episode also focused way too much on technology and concepts we've seen in previous episodes, which I guess maybe was the point, but it just felt a little lazy to me.

But clever is never enough, as the endless pun chains that dominate the top comments of Reddit thread responses show us. 

One good turn *demands* another. 

So, another. And another. And another. And now we're trapped by a formal property. And soon we're world-building. We're buying Red Apple Cigarettes, mourning Jungle Julia, and studying for our history final trying to remember which theater Adolf Hitler was killed in. *Anyone who knows what love is, will understand...*

The last episode of this season was great. It also explicitly starts pulling the threads together, creating a timeline of events. It is world-building. And this is potentially bad. Think of the weight of all that Star Trek canon which got in the way of the blue sky thinking which is needed to tell good tales of speculative fiction. 

World-building is weighty. It adds drag. You not only have to tell a good tale which is worthy of suspension of disbelief in *our world*, but which must also pass the test of memory in another world. This is great for Tolkien, where the whole point was to create a unified epic mythology for English people. It is not so great for tellers of episodic clever tales of possible futures. 

Recall the *X-Files.* Good fun, right? Monster of the moment. Familiar characters encountering a new ""weird"" every week. But then the show started world-building, tying threads together, and we were forever bogged down with space aliens. 

Think of America's great radio campfire, Coast-to-Coast. Art Bell served as our host for ""tales of bullshit"" from credulous-sounding folks attempting to sustain that sensation of the hairs on your arm standing on end. Occasionally, we'd accidentally get someone telling the truth about global warming prematurely, but it was mostly a bull session. But by the time George Noory took over the show, these tales of bullshit had been told so often, that there were now rules. Space aliens were now inter-dimensional beings with a hierarchy of forms. It moved from good times around the campfire to an accretion disk of bullshit with rules and regularities as tiring as your third playthrough of Skyrim. The fun was gone. 

The makers of Black Mirror need to be careful in deciding whether or not to take a bite from the Red Apple which falls from the tree of memory. Doing so give you a lot of plates to keep spinning and a lot of corners that you can paint yourself into. Myself, I hope that the connections subside and that we stay at the Easter Egg stage.

It's easy for us to criticise this over reliance, but honestly, when brainstorming ideas it's easy to fall into a VR plot because it presents countless intriguing possibilities. It's quite difficult to come up with something else. 

So my question to you is, what original concepts do you have for a potential fifth seasion that avoids the above tropes?

One day, they will reach perfection seen in Metalhead. Do you guys really think that as soon as they do, they won't be used in combat situations? 

Right now, we are bombing people with UAVs like nobody's bussiness. One day, we will have drones scavenging the battlefields for survivors. Once that technology gets in the hands of a government that decides its time for say, ethnic clensing or a hostile annexation of some territory, you get the Metalhead scenario. Dogs will be let loose and people will die - unless something is done to regulate their use in combat.

However from my perspective when it comes to violence and heinous acts in the real world - ultimately everything is temporary. Even acts such as the Holocaust and the raping of Nanking are temporary. People suffered but they are no longer suffering.

In which case what disturbed me most about Black Museum was the idea that human consciousnesses could be copied over and over again as souvenirs in which they suffer for eternity.

I'm sorry, but I could deal with the gore, the fucking monkey situation (considering that the poor lady was ultimately saved by Nish) but not the idea that thousands of those souvenirs are still out there with Nish's Dad suffering for eternity. How does Nish continue to live with that on her mind everyday?

Does anybody know if such an atrocity would ever be possible physically or scientifically speaking? Can you imagine all the sick cunts that would use that technology to their advantage over something as simple as revenge on an ex or a bully from school?

Regardless of whether or not such a thing is scientifically possible I would like to form a discussion with this subreddit about it so I can perceive it from a more logical point of view. 

I can't get the idea out of my head at the moment and really need some closure. I would rather be a victim of genocide or another Holocaust than to suffer for eternity. I cannot wrap my head around it.

I think a lot of people (myself included) were disappointed with it because we we were wanting a bigger or crazier story, but once I stepped back and took the episode for what it was, I think it's basically on par with Entire History of You.

&amp;nbsp;

**1. Character Development:** Out of all the episodes, I only slightly cared for a few characters (except for Hang the DJ). Many of the characters felt rushed and lacked a sense of grey morality. This hindered the shock value of the episodes as well as making me feel no empathy if a character died or got arrested.

&amp;nbsp;

**2. Reusing Concepts:** Booker said in a interview that the fourth series would have even more *variety* in the episodes than in previous series. I disagree with this. The whole transfer of consciousness idea &amp; devices that attach to your head has been overplayed and made 3 of the episodes not as imaginative as I expected them to be. The reason I believe Booker has been doing this leads to my next point.

&amp;nbsp;

**3. Shared Universe:** I believe that Booker has restricted himself from new ideas because he is trying to maintain a connection of all episodes through a shared universe. Therefore, he is rehashing new ideas/inventions and only coming up with different plots for these ideas. I don't mind a shared universe, but if it is going to affect the quality/spontaneity of an episode I believe it would be better to abandon it. 

&amp;nbsp;

**4. Too Much Hope:**  Booker said that there is ""more hope"" in the series. Bad move in my opinion. While I may have been a fan for a dash more hope in the previous series, it didn't work for this season because of the lack of *character development*.

Mostly just a rant. Don't expect any deep insight here. Just wanted to say how disappointing this season was. Seasons 1-3 were amazing, putting Black Mirror near the top as one of my favourite shows. Season 4 was a huge step down. Almost Rick and Morty season 3 bad, maybe a step higher.

Half the episodes were a different take on the same thing. Highly repetitive and highly boring by the end of it. Why do I care about these digital copies of people? I mean they're not actual people, they made that clear. From what they're told us they're basically a highly advanced version of what we'd create in The Sims. In this case they're just advanced enough to think they're real. One episode focusing on this could have been good, but not every second one.

I mean I can feel bad for them a little bit, but that's no different to feeling bad for a fictional character in a movie or tv show. In the end it's still not real. And they seem to go out of their way to mention they're not real, that they're just copies.

Two people were killed this season because they were mean to some digital copies of people. Could you imagine being killed because you tortured your character in The Sims? And I'm sure a lot of people made Sim-versions of people they didn't like, only to be mean to them and/or kill them off.

The episodes that tried to branch off a little, still weren't fleshed out very well. Literally nothing was explained in Metalhead. Why do I care about this lady or the robo-dog? 

Not one episode really made me feel much at all, nor did I ever have any 'what the fuck' type moments that previous season had. Often part way through the episode they'd reveal/explain something that made you fully understand what was happening, as you try to piece the episode together.

Crocodile was literally some women killing witnesses to cover up her murder. I was waiting for something more to happen, some reveal to come really fuck things up. Next minute the episode ended. 

Hang the DJ started off really well, it felt just like any other episode from previous seasons. But again I feel the ending was very lackluster. 

I hope season 5 gets better, because if it's anything like season 4 it'll be a struggle to get through it all.",False,blackmirror,Season 4 was severally disappointing.

9322,1514700496,7n6yp8,False,0,3,"A lot of people seem to have an issue with the use of “cookie” technology throughout this season.

While I agree that this technology was used too heavily in this season, I think it was done for a reason. 

Just to get this out of the way, “cookie” technology consists of Brain implants/consciousness/slavery etc

So allow me to make some observations about this season, and the show as a whole. 

“Cookie” tech has been used in:
“The Entire history of you” (kinda) S02
“White Christmas” S02
“Playtest” S03
“San Junipero” S03
“Men Against Fire” S03
“USS Callister” S04
“Arkangel” S04
“Crocodile” S04
“Black Museum” S04
“Hang the Dj” (kinda) S04

But, with “Black Museum” something changes. All of these references while they FEEL like fan service, it may be more symbolic. 

Perhaps, Charlie Booker wants to close the book on this type of story. It has been explored heavily in these new seasons and perhaps he wants to end this type of story and continue telling a different one. 

Many people believe that “Black Museum” seems like the end to the show, but maybe it’s an end to this type of story, now it opens the world to more possibilities.

“Black Museum” confirms that while Black Mirror is an anthology series, it all exists in the same universe, especially the universe that built and uses this type of technology.

I think that Booker is closing that chapter of the series, and we will see many more types of harrowing technology or what is done with technology in the seasons to come. 

TL:DR- Booker has used cookies this consistently on purpose, and we will see more expansion in later seasons. ",False,blackmirror,Something I noticed about Season 4.
9323,1514700424,7n6yhu,False,3,3,"I am sure there are other people who feel conflicted as well. A lot of people seem to empathize with both digital clones as well as consciousness that has been transferred from one person to another person/toy/hologram.

I personally can feel great deal of empathy for consciousness transfer because there is only 1 of that person, and it is being tortured for eternity.

But I don't know why people are mixing it with digital clones, like the **USS Callister** episode and **White Christmas.** In these episode the original human being in intact and happy. It's only the digital clones created via a procedure that are suffering.  Digital clones are just a bunch of codes that can be programmed to have no feelings, no original thoughts, no genitals etc.

And to top it all off they can be duplicated for unlimited number of times and killed again with the same method. Just like the dating app did in **Hang the DJ**. In a TV show we can feel empathy for them because we see them up close and personally suffering. Just like we would feel empathy for toys in toy story.

But in real world nobody would blink an eye if somebody started creating digital clones left, right and center and started slaughtering them with more codes.

So while I definitely feel that Robert Daly is dealing with his work issues and power trips in an extremely unhealthy way. He clearly needs therapy/help. But I don't see it as being unethical or illegal at all. Just like how people will feel in the real world once this kind of tech becomes a common place.

With episode 1, the idea that character based off a downloaded personality (with the actual person alive and well/unaffected by the game) having their own consciousness and feelings really made me pause a lot as well. Like, what are the ethics about a character being trapped inside a game without their consent? Can they truly be bored? Are they actual people or just code? What am I supposed to think?!?

I personally really loved the seasonal shift this episode threw in. ( yet to watch the last episode though.) I thought the previous episodes, whilst being generally great hadn't really thrown in a full on out there one, such as a fifteen million merits. Not that these two are similar in story, just that they present a world that is completely different from ours as opposed to the other episodes that (some of ) could almost happen or exist in the now. 

I know USS CALLISTER which I loved, seems like it's in another world, but it's still just earth where out of the game had advanced technology which one day we could achieve. Hang the Dj I loved also but was really this years san junipero. That's not a bad thing. In fact all these episodes are great. But I loved metal head for throwing in something that we haven't seen before.

It presented a world where we don't know how it became that way or why it's that way similar to fifteen million merits. I love the vagueness metal heads world exists in. Who made the dogs? The military, a terrorist cell? Maybe they where controlled by us and went rogue, who knows? 
How long has the world been like this? Etc. 
It's amazing world building where you want to know the answers but there's just enough given for you to speculate. Plus bonus points for making me feel like I was in a fallout game when that dude was hacking the car haha. 

I greatly understand the appeal of watching these fucked up scenairos take place in a world where we could easily slip into if we aren't careful. But I also love the being presented with a place so fucking out there you can't help but be interested 

I don't know, I thought it was acted great, shot great and had a vague but very interesting world in it. It felt like fallout, terminator and the early good eps of walking dead. It wasn't my favourite black mirror episode but for me it's certainly up there.

9434,1514685511,7n5qyf,False,20,15,"One thing I liked about previous seasons were the (relative) discreteness of the easter eggs to other seasons, like the news broadcasts or subtle stickers on laptops referencing other episodes. I was fine with this, because I don't care about the possibility of all these episodes existing in the same world. 

This season however... the references feel so out of place and feel like the showrunners are shoving them in your face. 

Does the audience really need explicit footage on ArkAngel of soldier work in Hated In The Nation or the 15 Million Merits song in Crocodile (""Oh I like that song"") and the references to the judge, which seems to be there solely to lead people to take wild guesses about that biking society. But why should we care?

9446,1514684423,7n5nl9,False,0,1,[removed],True,blackmirror,[SPOILERS - S4E4] I can’t stop thinking about Hang The DJ
9447,1514684410,7n5njp,False,11,15,"A lot of people here are talking about how Hang the DJ is a happy episode, with comparisons to season 3's San Junipero. However, unlike the simulated afterlife of San Junipero, the dating app in Hang the DJ is a nightmare.

White Christmas, San Junipero, USS Callister, Hang the DJ, and Black Museum (and possibly Fifteen Million Merits) are all stories about computer simulated minds. The overarching themes of these five episodes is that simulated persons are real persons. If a computer simulation is able to feel, to experience pleasure and suffering, then it makes no difference that it is running on a chip rather than on meat. Simulated consciousnesses have moral weight.

USS Callister features perhaps a dozen simulated consciousnesses, kept by Daly for perhaps a few years. During this time they are aware of their captivity, intermittently tortured, sexually assaulted (though thankfully mild), and coerced into demeaning roles in Daly's fantasies. This is clearly (and I believe rightly) depicted as evil.

Hang the DJ features at least two, but possibly many more, simulated consciousnesses. These simulations do seem to have moderately impaired awareness, to make it more difficult for them to realize they are in a simulation. However impaired their cognition, they must be capable of experiencing the full gamut of human emotions and relationship dynamics for the data gathered to have any value. These simulations experience both the heady ecstasy of falling in love, and the absolute agony of heartbreak.

At first blush, this situation appears more pleasant than that aboard the USS Callister. The Hang the DJ simulations have the pleasures of fine dining, cushy cabins, sport, sex, and love, while the captives of the USS Callister have nothing more for comfort and amusement than odd alien cocktails and banging their heads against desks. The dating simulations certainly do not experience the same degree of physical (or simulated physical?) pain as their counterparts in space.

All of this is outweighed by the scale of it. Assuming that only Frank and Amy are full consciousnesses, and everyone else a shell, and assuming that the simulation we see is indicative of the rest, then we have two thousand simulated persons each experiencing a year or more of boredom, annoyance, and heartache. Two thousand years of suffering, admittedly ameliorated by pleasure.

And that is only one couple. Since it seems that the trials are all run between two people, then every time someone in the world runs this app, it generates 2000 years of simulated experience. All to save two people the uncertainty of going on dates themselves to find someone compatible.

The only simulation episode that shows something more horrific is Black Museum, in which one man is subjected to captivity and extreme and repeated torture. The true horror here are the souvenir shards, constantly simulating a moment of unimaginable pain and suffering. Thousands, possibly tens of thousands, of these shards floating around the world, forgotten in the backs of drawers and buried in landfills, all simulating a moment of perfect hell.",True,blackmirror,"[Spoilers White Christmas, S3 E4, S4E1, S4E4, and S4E6] The events of Hang the DJ are more disturbing than the events of USS Callister."

I'm not sure if it's necessarily worse, but

Does anyone else feel like since coming to Netflix, it's an entirely new show?

The emphasis seems to have gone away from social commentary and actually lent into the whole ""what if phones, but too much"", where it's just using technology to tell stories without trying to say anything

It's like, the difference between something like The National Anthem and Hated in the Nation. Both are stories about public reaction to situations, but in TNA, that acts as a critique of sensationalism, whereas in HitN it just feels like the catalyst for a crime procedural.

In the same way White Bear and Shut Up and Dance's twists make you hate the protagonist you've been rooting for, WB uses this to make you question the morality of the situation and the extent to which someone can be punished, whereas in SUaD it's mostly there to? What? Make the audience feel gross for rooting for him?

I'm not saying either is objectively better - and there's a sprinkling of both types in both variations of the show - Entire History of You isn't trying to make a broad statement while something like Men Against Fire or Nosedive is. But even then in EHoY, which is just a character piece revolving around a technology, it still feels more honest than something like Playtest.

I found this again with USS Callister, where the technology is just an excuse to tell a story. Don't get me wrong, I loved the episode, but it was kind of a lightbulb moment that the show's not as concerned with creating another 15 Million Merits as it used to be.

9465,1514682718,7n5i4g,False,4,17,"So I've been seeing a lot of discussion about how Metalhead didn't really fit into the overall theme of this series, the theme being usually being a commentary on humans or society as a whole.


I disagree with this for a couple of reasons. I'll start off by just saying that it was an awesomely tense episode, and should be celebrated for that alone. I think that that is the point of this show, it's to make you afraid. Usually this fear arises from a new technology that could exist, and how it reflects on humanity as a whole. Many people have complained that this episode didn't raise the same philosophical questions as the others have, however I still felt the same type of dread watching it. I think the reason for this is this episode, like the others, demonstrates a human struggle against a soulless, inhuman threat which we created. 


The Dog was a beautifully designed piece of machinery. But what I kept thinking was that it was just that - designed. Engineered by someone human. Which begged the question: why? Why was it able to hack into any interface it came across? Why did the engineer know this would be necessary? Why was there a chuck behind its knee to attach a weapon to? Why does it embed trackers into the people it meets, even after it has died? The unsettling implication is that the designer drafted this robot, over and over again, planning for any eventuality, thinking to themselves about how best to outsmart A FELLOW HUMAN. Taking a totally detached, calculated approach to murder.


This episode might not have had a view to societal implications of the technology, but it certainly looked at how a human could make something so abstract and cold. We've been considering this episode as humans vs. machines, but when you think about it, it's really humans falling into their own, intricately engineered trap. Which is what the other episodes look at in the same way - albeit less on the nose. I get that the teddy bear twist could have been more poignant, but I think it served to emphasize the contrast between the emotional, sentimental humans, and their unnecessarily cruel, emotionally colourblind* creation.

There's USS Callister 'Star Fleet' version...

It plays out just as a Star Fleet episode would; Robert is a bad person, a sociopath, a person deserving of retribution. Our heros eventually outsmart Robert in a ""real"" version of events that played out in the beginning of the episode during Robert's game. All the cliches are there, even the guy sacrificing himself to get the engines started. The 'Star Fleet' audience(or the netflix masses) is happy with this morality play, the evil man was done in by his hubris. Happy endings and 1970s laughs are had by all. We learn the harsh lesson that we need to treat our Sims better, lest they rise up and make the buggars eye's water. But is this a Black Mirror episode? No, this is....

The USS Callister Black Mirror version...

Robert is a deeply flawed man, of course, he's creepy, he's very angry, he's resentful. He takes out his frustrations on his NPCs, as a lot of us do. He's a person regardless, and a well-mannered one in the waking world. But he's also a flawed programmer, which can be deadly in such a technologically integrated world. The NPCs are able to outsmart him, once again, due to their code. Cookie Nanette manipulates waking Nanette into supplementing their plan, a plan that, in my opinion, leads to the death of Robert in that chair. Authorities will certainly know she was in his apartment, especially given tech in this world, and I think it's safe to assume they see her there acting shady and surmise she had something to do with it. Cookie Nanette, in seeking freedom from her own prison, has put waking Nanette into actual prison.

So thats the ruination of two lives at the expense of these lines of code. I know there will be argument that there's more to these copies than lines of code, the show encourages as much, but in this universe that's all they are at this point. Waking Nanette would agree, she only done this because of the blackmail, had she known the entire truth of the matter she would have been extremely creeped out, disgusted even, but she's a coder....she would NOT feel sympathy for her copy, definitely wouldn't break into a man's house to help it.

So this is the actual Black Mirror tragedy that lies underneath the crowd-pleasing hero's journey.  Robert and Nanette are both deeply tragic charchters, the victims of another ""dangerous AI"" motif that we see from this show so frequently.

Sorry if this has already been wide discussed here, just felt it worth laying out, for my own sanity if nothing else.

I'm pretty strongly of the opinion that this is a different technology and that what we're seeing is more of a digital representation of how the dating app interprets someone's personality traits. Kind of like how OKcupid will attempt to match you with someone similar based off of how you've described yourself. Or how something like Bing will use all of the different stats regarding two sports teams and simulate several matches between them to determine who's more likely to win a game. I think what we got in Hang the DJ is a visual representation of this, just much more advanced than what we have in the present day. I just wanted to share my response to someone regarding my thoughts on the cookie vs digital person debate. Here it is:

One of the main reasons that I'm inclined to see it this way is because the episode didn't concern itself at all with any moral implications surrounding the number of simulations or the ethical use of the digital people. The other episodes we have in the series make a point to examine the philosophy surrounding the cookies and what it means to be consciously human and possess rights to life and autonomy. This episode didn't do that at all and so I don't think we're supposed to view them as the same thing. It was much more concerned with kind of taking us inside of the simulations behind the dating app and didn't worry itself at all with ethics or morality. Just my two cents.

I could be wrong, and hopefully we hear from Brooker about this one day, as I think it's a pretty interesting topic, but this is how I interpreted this episode. What do guys think?

Turns out, Charlie Brooker is very aware of that, and, in fact, deliberately wrote the season that way, as he pointed out [in this interview](http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/black-mirror/news/a845347/black-mirror-season-4-charlie-brooker/):
 
&gt; ""There is some more hope in this series,"" Brooker said at a screening last night (December 12) in central London.
&gt; 
&gt; ""This season, the writing of it started in July 2016, so there were episodes being written all through the American election... and everything was looking horrible. I genuinely thought, I don't know what state the world's going to be in by the time these [episodes] appear, and I don't know how much appetite there will be for nothing but bleak nihilism.
&gt; 
&gt; ""If you're living in a dystopia, you don't necessarily want to look at another one. So I sort of thought, let's maybe not make them all [depressing]. Although, the thing is, you have to be aware that a lot of people tune in for that. So you still want to give them that.""
&gt; 
&gt; ""Part of it is, it gets too predictable,"" Brooker said of switching up the feel and flavour of episodes. ""If every single episode is like... 'And then, it all f**ked up', then you're just waiting for that to happen, and so it becomes very predictable.""

So there you have it. Charlie thought the world was fucked and depressing enough right now, and thus decided to ease up on the bleakness and existential terror a little bit.

Personally, I'm an existential masochist. It can't be too bleak or too fucked up for me, so I'm left wanting a bit more. But I was still thoroughly entertained by this season. Still hoping that season 5 - if we're even getting one, since this has been the second half of the 12 episodes Netflix commissioned in 2015 - will go back to being *merciless*.",False,blackmirror,[Brooker Quote] Why Season 4 has so many happy endings

I have an alternative view on the episode, one where this isn’t about authority and where Daley may actually be a good person.

I think this episode is looking at what it means to be human. 
We are drawn to feel bad for the in game characters because they have he conscious ability to feel, to remember, and to show emotion. But they are in fact not real. They are human-like characters within the confines of a digital game. They are human-like, not human. 
But animals aren’t human...yes, but animals are living creatures, these in-game characters are not living. 

Even their bodies are not within human possibility (blue skin, no genitals, ...). 
The fact that Daley is taking out his anger (likely from loneliness) in a video game is better than him taking it out with violence in the real world. 
Often we think of people becoming violent because of video games, but what if this is the opposite scenario. Daley is not abusing his power of authority as CTO (however is likely a little too “laissez faire” in his position as a leader in the company). 

If we found out that characters within the Sims game has the ability to have real emotions and feel in the same way as humans, we using them as characters be wrong? They’re within the confines of a digital game and are not alive.

Specifically, I am increasingly disturbed that the wife of the 'breaker' left him over his extra 'hobby' of being a sort of Twitch-plays-pick-up-artist, whereas his actual job was *torturing* seemingly sentient copies into submission. It sketches a society which seems incredibly prude (live-streaming private information puts you on an equivalent of the pedo-list) while also having no regard for intelligent life. If someone told had me chose in dating two people with the dating and the breaking scenarios, I would never, ever date the breaking person. I would sooner date someone who throws darts at kittens.

It is also interesting that although the legal status of the copies is never mentioned in *USS Callister*, it does hint that the actual underlying code in the cloud is sufficiently advanced to run advanced human-like constructs. So potentially the people trying to escape all worked at a company which runs servers on which NPC's exist who are at least technically capable of having their level own sophistication. Which really makes it harder to conclude how immoral *they* were for making these products.

I think it is an interesting theme in Black Mirror that at first the technology seems harrowing; but really in most episodes the *real* problem seems a lack of care or a lack of law. To the point that the killer in White Christmas was described as odd because he *did* care about the 'code people'.

It is like a society of high-technology with the lack of self-awareness you find in 19th century novels, in which the downtrodden and the slaves are quite literally not cared about. Is there even a fringe group in these societies fighting for the rights of these constructs?

Then  the second season came, and so did the Christmas Special which kept on blowing my mind and hooking me up,. After seeing it a few times it left me numb, I just wanted more of this, you could say I had the withdrawal

Sadly, desperately sadly I got what I wanted  however not what I expected. It was obvious something changed, I don't know if that was because Netflix was behind or because there were too many episodes in such a short amount of time (I'm the kind of guy that understands inspiration takes time) . Yet I watched it a couple of times and I got plenty of it, choked on it. The show became painful to watch, simple, dull and simple. It became a decoration, the plot was just a boring cut-and-paste mainline story with some sprinkled tech here and there.

But then the fourth came, and I have to say I'm hugely disappointed, as a matter of fact, I've only watched the first 3 episodes of this season, let me title them for you :
1) A glorified Star trek episode
2) A bad mother with no privacy boundaries
3)  A bad mother with no negotiation skills
Now, each episode has it's own independent story, however I found some similarities, first of all the episodes are dealing with well-known moral issues; the second thing is one I hate deeply and it's the plot holes, ignoration-of-science-facts-for-the-sake-of-argument and such... But the thing I particularly hated the most was the characters. They are just stupid. When I see this I feel the writers think the viewers are as stupid as the characters, I won't elaborate this further.

In conclusion, I'm sad to see where the show is been heading the last 2 seasons, I personally could come with a far better story, this much I can guarantee (and many, many people too)

And I love it.

I actually waited until today to watch the new season because basically I wanted to sleep, but after finishing the first episode I wasn't disturbed or wanted to put my phone away for hours, I just thought ""wow I really liked the characters"" or I felt really emotionally impacted by it.

The technology used became more of a Macguffin to set the plot in motion, well not per se, because I still cared about it. loads of it was about simulated conciousness, and it made you think about it on an emotional level, not on a theoretical one, which I love.

Take Metalhead for example, which was my favourite episode of this season, because it was just superbly executed SciFi Horror. Almost got a Lovecraftian vibe from it. There is these things. That know no mercy. That have no Face. That know no reason, you could comprehend and then: they are after you, and as a viewer you don't even know why. It made me think about drones and combat tech yes, but it made me feel way more. Much owed to David Slade and his use of B&amp;W and close ups/extreme close ups. It is never explained yet the ending sequence makes it more humane and more bleak at the same time, while also using Bella as a metaphor for the entire human population.

USS Callister is just standard good vs evil, think about simulations, but the characters are enticing. Arkangel really got me hooked, the subject matter isn't even that dark, yet I loved the characters so much I was screaming ""NO. FUCK. FUCK"" by the end of it.

USS Callister: There's a weird tonal shift from the first mission to choking out Jimmy, but otherwise it was great! I especially loves that he keeps the Kirk cadence even when he's pissed off. That's commitment to the bit, right there. 

Arkangel: Oh look, Jodi Foster wrote an episode. It must be about a kid being kidnapped or going missing, and a parent losing their shit about it. Just like literally everything else she's ever written. 

Crocodile: Slow. Boring. And confusing. I know, let's make the main character lose all agency, make bad decisions, and dial her up to psychotic baby killer for no reason! #GuineaPigSavesTheDay. Fuck you, show. 

Hang the DJ: Okay...I actually do like this episode. But only because I'm house hunting, and these tiny homes look amazing. It's a great setup, but it's squandered at the end. It's Tinder? Really? They're just meeting at a bar? I would have totally taken the ""final test"" being that they shrugged off the computer and decided to be together, and that was the plan all along! Yeah, it's a little hackneyed, and a trope, but it's better ending than what we got. You know what else is a better ending? Anything else. 

Metalhead: FIDO with a knife stabs speakers. Stupid decisions abound. And not a fan of black and white just for the sake of it. This isn't Logan. You're not doing cinematic eye candy. It's three scavengers who are bad at their job. Risking their lives for a teddy bear. And for that matter, is it just the dogs? Did humanity get taken down by robot dogs who have trouble standing up? A reveal of a far more daunting enemy situation would have made this a lot better. I can embrace my existential fear a little bit better if I know that winning is impossible. This wasn't impossible. Experienced scavengers would be used to dealing with these dogs, wouldn't they? I'm just pissed off we spent an hour in a universe with people who aren't very good at their jobs. Moreover, what's the lesson!? What's the value to be taken away here?! It's not even the standard; ""Don't be a prick"" lesson. Just; here's a post apocalypse where we run from robot dogs. Great. Thanks.

Black Museum: So...I do like it. It's very well done. And a mini anthology episode, inside and anthology series that links a lot of the stories together in a tangible reality is a well needed and deserved reward. The stories themselves were good, though I didn't really need the mutilation of the good Doctor, but the monkey, convict, and daughter angles were well worth the watch. Plus, it gets bonus points for just how much better it is than the rest of the series. I do have questions though
- Why did she need to pretend to be British?
- Why do the keychains have a mini-consciousness always in pain, instead of a video?
- How is that legal, but the monkey situation is now illegal? 
- Is she going to go on a murder-quest to hunt down and kill the keychain copies of her tortured dad now? 
- Wait, why was her dead mom who committed suicide in her head at the end? I mean, aside from poetic justice. 
- There's no public museum that doesn't sell water. Especially in the desert. Was your plan to actually wait for him to ask you for some of your water? There was a backup plan to bash his head in before you got to your Dad, right? Hopefully?

* Psychedelics, nootropics, brain altering tech etc going mainstream, transforming society into a neo-hippy utopia (which of course ends up being a dystopia)

After all the Cookie gets tortured, but not you. You just continue living your life. No-brainer.

I on the other hand argued that it's a little more complex than that. I actually argued that you would shoot yourself in the foot and under no circumstances should you get a cookie.
Because the cookie clone is also basically YOU.
You can't just say: ""I'll continue living my life. it's the cookie who'll get the bad end of the stick.""

It would be really interesting if they did a follow up episode about one of the simulations where they gave up. It would allow for a really dark ending like the rest of Black Mirror, give more time for us to learn about the simulation world (since they don't need to show us the characters meeting up with others), show a really interesting reaction when (or if) they found out they were in a simulation and they kind of ""failed"" the test, and appeal to the show's creators because it would act as a kind of gimmick (being the first episode to have continue a story line) that would draw attention to the show and the season the episode is in. 

Of course, this idea would only work if it was executed really well. It would need to be a lot different from Hang the DJ to make an unique episode. It might also help to focus more on the flaws of the simulation, such as the rock skipping thing, and that might have caused Amy to go insane (in this iteration) instead of rebelling. Another idea would be having Amy have flashbacks to her real life.

I can see it being a horrible episode or possibly working really well. If they ever did it (which I doubt they would), Netflix would probably have to put a notification before watching that explained how you needed to watch Hang the DJ first. It could work as a standalone episode that just had the same characters and setting but a story unique enough to be watched before Hang the DJ without extra context.

9629,1514666255,7n3wim,False,0,2,"Many of us believe the single universe theory for BM, but season 4 made me rethink this theory.
Even before season 4 there were a few episodes that didn't have any ties to the single universe, like San Junipero for example.  Season 4 does seem to bring it into the single universe with TCKR being a main point in Black Museum.
This is the point where I get to the Netflix Theory
I believe that there is not a single universe, but two universes.  One real, one being a fiction TV Show (on Netflix).
The first point that set this theory in motion is in USS Callister when Dailey mentions that Netflix exists.  At first I thought this just may be a simple nod at Netflix existing, but the second point truly set my theory in motion.
In Arkangel, we see a clip from Men against Fire being shown to Sara.  If the clip was in first person you could use the excuse that it was just a recording from MASS, but we don't see it in first person.  We specifically see the clip in the exact manor that it appears in the Netflix episode.
As I link together the episodes, I can see that every episode is connected indeed, however, I can see 2 individual worlds with limited connections between the two.  A prime example is when Black Museum ties a large amount of episodes together using TCKR.
A rule of thumb that seems to work for the most part is that UKN means Netflix universe and TCKR Means real world.
There are a few problems with this theory though.  Prime example being Abi's song in many episodes across both theoretical universes.  This can be answered easily that people would watch the show then like the song and play it.  You can see other examples where Real world mentions Netflix world with little examples going the other way.
Ways to define the separate worlds is to define the type of connection, being a thought connection (ideas, songs, phrases, etc.) or a physical connection (technology).  Thoughts can easily go from fiction to real and vice versa, physical items not as easily.  From this I can determine that there is a single thought universe and two distinct physical universes where one is a TV Show on Netflix.",True,blackmirror,The Netflix Theory [SPOILERS]

9638,1514665363,7n3tdq,False,0,2,"Overall, this season had many solid episodes, especially with all the strong symbolism in Black Museum. There is just one small detail that I’ve just noticed after thinking back to all the episodes to find overarching themes. This detail doesn’t affect the quality and structure of the episodes, but I think it could be something of note and not just an unintentional ‘didn’t think about that’ aspect that the makers glanced over. The obvious thing to me was that it’s just looking too deeply at a small detail, but when it comes to analyzing stories I always give the benefit of the doubt and assume that it’s something significant, then see how far I can support it before disproving it.

From what I can remember, the first time I noticed scifi fandoms being part of the storyline was with the gatekeeping cosplayers in Nosedive. The second time was in USS Callister. In both instances, they presented the bad side of scifi fandoms. In real life, these fans with bad personalities are an annoyance to many and I’m glad they show up, but I can’t recall any instance where Black Mirror has shown a positive side of scifi fandoms. It’s clear the makers of the show are scifi fans themselves, from the numerous references from shows like Star Trek thrown in the series, so they don’t hate on scifi fans. But with the absence of positive portrayals, and noting that Black Mirror always tries to get the viewer to self-examine themselves and think about morally grey areas, is there a deeper message that the makers are trying to get viewers to ponder on and discuss? I want to look for counterexamples to the observation that ‘there were no positive portrayals’, so it would be helpful if anyone can point them out.

There is nothing odd with not representing both sides of a demographic in a show, because forcing representation would be a restriction of artistic freedom. However, for a series that has done an amazing job at showcasing both sides of people from many different backgrounds, it stands out that they don’t show any positive side of scifi fandoms. No show has the obligation to showcase both sides, but with the knowledge that the audience will look deep into its subtle social commentaries, Black Mirror is one of the shows that clearly makes an effort to do so. 

One example of an easy change I think they could have made is if they wrote that Nanette one of the good fans to contrast with Daly, who’s one of the bad fans. It seemed like no character in that episode had any positive view of Star Fleet. One reason I can think of why they kept on poking fun at fandoms is for comedic purposes, but then I thought about it more and I think they also wanted to create a morally grey area where it seems like all the good guys are against Daly, which sort of makes you pity him but also hate him for what he does. The gatekeepers in Nosedive were mostly background fluff, though I liked how they were there to show every community, even weird ones, has judgmental pricks.

9639,1514665311,7n3t7j,False,5,0,"USS Callister was not an instant classic in my book..the premise had already been discussed in both white christmas and the playtest episodes...the cast was very strong but the story seemed quite linear till the end...
However,after giving it a significant amount of thought.. this episode is not a story of triumph of a hero over and opressing villain yet a similar story to Ex-Machina(a fantastic sci fi film where a guy creates an A.I treats it badly and it evantually kills him) where a couple of lines of code have caused the death of a non criminal yet extremely sick man.
The Final scene has all the characters smiling and triumphant music playing giving you the impression that everything is ok and the heroes have triumphed
however the shot showing a guy mentally vegetated for playing a video game is quite shocking as the A.I he developped lead to his ultimate demise.
the counter argument of course is that scentience cannot be measured by physical presence in this universe and that the lines of code are based on human DNA so must have rights
However if i created a game where the villain looks and acts like a person i hate and i beat him to death every time no would call my act criminal or demeaning(certaimly not sain of course but you get my point)
TLDR:Please Watch Ex-Machina and then re-Thinck your opinion of scentience and who actually won at the end of this episode.",False,blackmirror,How USS Callister is so intellegently dark that you miss it!!

2. why did Mia agree to let her use the machine? Shazia told her she had to speak with her about the incident she witnessed or else she would have to get police involved because it is a crime not to report it. but she never said she HAD to let her use the machine. it was just dumb for Mia to agree to it, obviously she's impulsive, but she seemed intelligent enough to not agree to something that had a great potential to reveal her secrets. 

3. why would Shazia lie to Mia about not telling anyone she was there when she knew Mia could use the same machine to see her memories and see she is lying? 
The only thing i could think of is that Shazia didn't think Mia would be able to use it, or that Mia even had brought the machine in there. 

4. how the hell do you get an objective memory from a hamster? the investigator had to ask questions to get people going about specific memories. hamsters don't speak or understand english. 

i really liked the episode i just keep going back to those questions. i kept hoping Shazia would plead to Mia that she had a baby at home, not that Shazia knew, but Mia's defense to her ex when he wanted to talk about the hit and run was that she has a young son and she can't be in jail because he needs her etc. 
I wonder if Shazia had told Mia that her son was a blind baby if Mia would have had any mercy on her? but then again probably not because Mia is extremely selfish, and in her mind only her and her child mattered, nobody else's family matters as evidenced by her massacres.

In all the past episodes of black mirror we know that Cookies gradually got more rights as time went on and some projects where even banned, simply because it was unethical without actually harming anyone (Arkangel was forbidden for example, and something like Carrie in that Teddy is also no longer allowed). 

We also know that Rolo, even though it may seem unethical, generally wanted to help people with his job. All devices could have been abused, but that was never his intention when his company developed them. He wanted to help those patients, he wanted to free Carrie from her coma. Never charging anyone. He didnt force anyone, always gave them their own options. Even helped them afterwards, when problems occured.

This doesnt make any sense according to his character, and the universe itself.

9748,1514654305,7n2oyt,False,5,1,"In the end of the episode, the guy says ""We've got an infinite procedurally generated universe [1] (PGU) at our disposal. We can go anywhere"" as the spaceship pass by Saturn. So that means that they are free from Infinity and they can choose what they want to do. What if they reach Earth on the procedurally generated universe? Will people be there? If no, why? If yes, will it be like ""Another Earth"" [2], a movie which there is an Earth 2 and [SPOILER] the main character meets her other ""me""? [/SPOILER] Will the crew be able to meet themselves, even in the PGU? [SPOILER] In ""Another Earth"" we see that both earth are connected but that doesn't mean that the same thing will happen on both planets [/SPOILER]. And that is my point. Real Earth and virtual Earth are connected but people on both planets that guide what is going to happen, even if they are the same (genetically, physically, etc). What if they tell those people that they are in a PGU? 

I'm just theorizing that because when I saw Saturn I realized that Saturn and any other planet is realistic represented by the way they are known, except Earth, that needs to have people because if doesn't have people it isn't Earth. So maybe the GPU's creators thought about that.

Another thing that I would like to theorize is about connection between real and virtual world/galaxy. What if people from real world find out that there's a way to contact with characters that were created to play in a specific game? We saw in USS Callister that they could send message to people in real world and that is facinating. What if people in real world could answer the message? What if NASA decides to explores some things in space through the (virtual) people that are ""living"" in space games such as asking questions, sending directions, giving them missions, receiving reports, etc? That would be pretty much easier to NASA because sending people to space takes a long time, costs money and it's dangerous. 

I thought about this theory remembering ""Interestellar""'s [3] scenes, specially the black hole one. In the movie and in the TV Show we saw that a black hole guided them to another dimension and that dimension can be understood, in USS Callister, as another PGU.

Just one more thing: Is it possible to procreate in a game? In the end of the episode, they all got their genitals back and my question is ""why?"". Is it because in a GPU things are realistically represented by the things that exist in real world? (So that makes me think again: Earth will be realistically represented and will have people in the PGU?). If it's possible to have children in a game (and that doesn't mean that in the real world it will happen, as I said before), won't people/couples in real world wish to put their DNA in a game, create another ""me"" and procreate with someone to see how the baby is going to look like? The Black Mirror's world  could definitely have another and easier way to predict how a baby is going look like, but it could be another option, because parents could raise their kids virtually before they decide to procreate in the real world. The virtual option would be good because of the feelings you could have and because of the power to correct mistakes you would do virtually (considering the fact it's the first time you are raising a kid, for example).

9750,1514654245,7n2oq4,False,11,125,"This is an attempt at a cohesive Mirrorverse. A few comments:

* Naturally, **massive spoilers**.

* I've not read other attempts at Mirrorverses which I now realise there are on this sub. Any similarities are accidental. However, I'm not aware of any S4 ones, and given S4 seemed to try and tie in the other episodes a bit more, hopefully this should be more unique.

* I haven't rewatched all the episodes recently, so if some details are a little bit off then that's my bad.

* I initially ordered the episodes based on technology - those based on technology available today (e.g. National Anthem), 'near future' technology with a recognizable society to what we have now (e.g. Playtest), 'far future' technology with an unrecognizable society (e.g. Nosedive), and 'post-apocalyptic' society (Waldo and Metalhead) - rather than based on the little easter eggs they throw in that are only on screen for 1 second. So this may not make sense from a 'but in such and such an episode they said Michael Callow was still the PM in a bit of scrolling text at the bottom of a tv screen but you have someone else!' kind of way.

* The choice to make fifteen million merits a fiction-within-a-fiction was based on the character from Black Museum reading it as a book. The only way I could rationalise that happening is if it was in-universe.

* I know there isn't a consistent Black Mirror universe, this was more of a thought experiment than a fan-theory to be like ""This is how it is!""

Iain Rannoch murders a child while Victoria Skillane films. The then-prime minister bows to media pressure and founds the White Bear correctional facility, which gradually evolves into dishing out ironic punishments on the criminals therein for media entertainment. **[S2E2 White Bear]**

After an empathetic campaign in the next general election, Michael Callow narrowly becomes the new prime minister. He fails to close White Bear due to rogue MPs in his own party and opposition from the outgoing party.

An art-terrorist cell is founded in the United Kingdom, fanatically focused on criticising society’s reliance on technology. Activities included:

* Blackmailing PM Michael Callow into having sex with a pig. His approval rating soars but his marriage begins to unravel. The artist commits suicide. **[S1E1 National Anthem]**
* Releasing malware to incriminate various people in the UK, including three paedophiles, an adulterer, a closet racist and a CEO. **[S3E3 Shut Up and Dance]**

The malware was traced to the cell and they were destroyed by the police. This was heavily reported by the mainstream media which ironically better spread their subversive message. Unsuccessful and jaded comedian Jamie Salter’s character Waldo unsuccessfully runs for a local election and then goes on to be sold to an American intelligence agency. **[S2E3 The Waldo Moment]** 

A series of successful graphic novels criticising technology and modern Britain are published, the most popular being ’15M Merits’, making references to real-world institutions such as the talent show Hot Shots and pornographer Wraith Babes. **[S1E2 Fifteen Million Merits]** A lengthy legal battle ensues regarding the relationship between copywrite and satire. 

SaitoGemu begins developing AR video games, eventually accidentally killing Cooper, an American tourist, which leads to their closure. **[S3E2 Playtest]** Meanwhile, in the US, Rolo Haynes, based at St Junipers Hospital, develops early medical technology, including the ability to transmit pain and physically transfer consciousness from one body to another. Having illegally transferred the consciousness of Carrie, a coma patient, from living vessel Jack to an inanimate monkey, Rolo is fired. **[S4E6 Black Museum / Dr Pain &amp; Carrie’s Story]**
The work of SaitoGemu and St Junipers allowed for the development of early technology used by private institutions or in small trials:

* Work by SaitoGemu into manipulating brainwaves allows for the development of rudimentary memory scanning, used by UK police and private investigators for settling legal matters. A famous case was that of Mia Nolan, who’s arrest was primarily based on the memories of Codger the family Guinea Pig. **[S4E3 Crocodile]**
* SaitoGemu’s alternate reality technology found its way to the Department of Defence, who began using in military applications to initially provide tactical advantage and then to dehumanise the opposition. **[S3E5 Men Against Fire]**
* St Junipers’ understanding of the human consciousness was passed on to a small start-up company who attempted to create artificial consciousnesses from social media feeds. These were infamously poor recreations and were seen as creepy and unnecessary. The company soon stopped supporting its products and made its software open-source. **[S2E1 Be Right Back]**

As is often the case, military technology found civilian applications, and the ArkAngel trial began in the UK, allowing parents to view what their children can see, block out anything harmful, and read relevant biochemistry to monitor their wellbeing. This was soon made illegal due to negative impacts on children’s development, helped along by the high-profile disappearance of fifteen-year-old Sara Sambrell. **[S4E2 Arkangel]**

A popular dating app, The System, begins using the open-source artificial consciousness software in live compatibility modelling between artificial models of its users. It becomes the most downloaded social app for the 18-30 age bracket. **[S4E4 Hang the DJ]**

In the US, the murky legality of handling consciousnesses continues to grow murkier. The first breakthrough comes in the medical community, in the form of palliative care, allowing consciousness of dying patients to live on in the fictional San Junipero, created by medical technicians in St Junipers. This came with the caveat that patients could choose to leave at any stage. **[S3E4 San Junipero]**

While the UK refocuses technological focus from bio-based technology to robotics (approving the use of ADIs to replace declining bee populations, as well as to replace CCTV), the US accelerates adoption of consciousness transference tech, helped in part by the success of San Junipero and the growing popularity of the Blue Bear Party. Robert Daly, genius social recluse and video game developer, founds Callister with college roommate James Walton, using similar technology to St Junipers to temporarily transfer players into their video game avatars. Daly was eventually found dead in his apartment having been unable to transfer his consciousness back out of a personal modded client, and it was uncovered that he had created fully conscious NPCs which he would ritualistically psychologically abuse. **[S4E1 U.S.S Callister]**

The botched investigation into the mysterious deaths of controversial journalist Jo Powers, rapper Tusk, and Clara Meades by Karin Parke and Blue Coulson – whereabouts unknown – leads to the deaths of 387,036 UK residents. **[S3E6 Hated in the Nation]** Capitalising on public fear, the UK government increases CCTV and domestic surveillance, eventually reintroducing an ArkAngel-like system as part of the ‘grain programme’ incentivising its early adoption with tax incentives, insurance reductions, the personal benefit of replaying memories, and the retirement of the more inconvenient methods that were once used to catch Mia Nolan. **[S1E3 The Entire History of You]** Adoption was swift and eventually the grains were upgraded to Z-eyes, allowing new functionality including the ability to access the internet and ‘block’ people the user deemed fit. **[S2E4 White Christmas / Technology]**

Meanwhile in the US the Blue Bear Party finally gains office and begins to legislate by committee, allowing all American citizens to vote for change on their phones. This began a technological wild-west where almost anything went, including consciousness transference and replication. 

Rolo Haynes acquires artefacts from police auctions and, his greatest, acquisition, the digital ‘soul’ of Clayton Lee, which he allows the general public to repeatedly execute in the Black Museum until Clay’s daughter, Nish, and wife, deceased but whose consciousness inhabited Nish’s mind after the now re-legalised procedure Rolo’s company invented, murdered him and burnt the museum down. **[S4E6 Black Museum / Clay’s Story]** The new legal system under Waldo led to the ability for everyone to rate each other, allowing for a judgemental society based entirely on people’s opinions of others. **[S3E1 Nosedive]**

Matt Trent escapes to the UK and has a Z-eye installed, which he uses to coach others as a pick-up artist. He continues to do this on the side after he gets a job installing domestic ‘cookies’ after Waldo becomes the UK PM and the UK adopts US-like consciousness laws. After his voyeurism is discovered he is arrested, but the police use his knowledge of cookies to catch murderer Joe Potter. **[S2E4 White Christmas / Story]**

As Waldo is adopted more and more across the world, the ruling classes are increasingly able to introduce more brutal controls from a ‘bottom up’ perspective – first on people rated as 0, then 1, then 2, etc. While an illusion of democracy is still maintained, secret police punish those who vote against the wishes of the ruling party. **[S2E3 The Waldo Moment / Credits]** 

Gradually robotic enforcers are introduced, which opened up for a collective mass rebellion as the citizens of the UK voted for the enforcers to attack the ruling class. Where before rebellions could be circumvented before laws or decisions were made, a slip up meant the enforcers received the order immediately and began dismantling the ruling class. However, this led to the destruction of the Waldo voting servers, removing the ability to change the directive of the enforcers as they gradually worked their way down through society, as each class became the new ‘ruling class’, wiping out the majority of the UK population **[S4E5 Metalhead]**.

Nanette enters the game and the story shifts the focus to her and the rest of the crew, and it basically becomes Toy Story, which is bad.

USS Callister - ep 1:  Why couldn’t Daly exit the game at the end?  He wasn’t in the wormhole yet and he had the equipment he needed. 

How did real life Nanette get outside Daly’s high rise?  

For me this episode was conflicting because yeah Daly stole DNA to make cookies of real life people in the Infinity game, so he was a dick for doing that and the way he treated them. It made me root for the cookies, but in the end I realized Daly was deleted IRL and those f’n cookies did that. Classic Black Mirror. 

Crocodile - ep 3:  Why was this titled crocodile - anyone understand this reference?  

When Shazia went to interview Mia she didn’t smell the alcohol on her breath and decide the results of the recaller would be skewed?  Mia’s husband could smell it on her much later in the day. Did she just want that 24hr commission so bad she did it anyway?

Hang the DJ - ep 4:  Explain the ending to me.  The episode is about cookies that simulate dating for people so they don’t have to. When Amy and Frank rebel against the system in the cookie world and escape over the wall there are a bunch of other couples there as well and we see a thousand number. Does this correlate to the 99.8% and I missed it?  

What happens if people don’t rebel?

Were the couple getting married who say “trust the system” also rebels?  My wife thinks they aren’t real and the system made them up like the guards.  Interesting point because why would they get married in the simulation?  If they were rebels then the simulation ends.   Are we essentially just watching the dating system code play out and that’s the entire episode?

Metalhead - ep 5:  Any theories on the devil dogs?  Who or what released them?  Why are they killing?  This episode appears to be a minuscule snapshot of an interesting world. I find myself more interested in the how or whys this world exists rather than the actual story. Seems to be some depth needed from rewatching.

The compatibility between the two actors was fantastic, it felt like they were going to do them wrong. I'm happy it ended with the beginning of a new story but all I could think of is that situation, in a bar, on a dating app, being told that you're a percentage match with another person.

If they showed us the beautiful romance that the two characters experienced, showed that after 1000 simulations only two did not end the same, and then finished with their mobile phones displaying a 99.8% compatibility rating. Only for them to then either ignore it, or hook up for a one night stand then go their separate ways, I think that would have been a sombre and some what painful ending for us the viewers, whilst holding true to something that happens all too often in the world today.

How these dating sites come to calculate percentages is not given much consideration, so are easily ignored. We would rather look at profile pictures and swipe left or right (albeit nowadays we simply answer questions rather than create digital clones of ourselves when creating a dating profile..) so when a number does appear it isn't appreciated half as much as it would be, if for example we were actually able to sit and comprehend the journey that the systems, the algorithms took to get there.

Out of all the episodes I think even the weaker ones have a certain bar of quality that makes a rewatch worth it. Not this one though. It lacks all the things that makes a Black Mirror episode what it is. There was no insightful technological concept that keeps you pondering the possibilities of the universe long after watching, no shocking twists that we've all come to love, and worst of all it simply felt like there was no plot at all.  

I understand they were trying something different and the same formula can go stale, but by doing so the episode fell into the trap of simply becoming a generic post-apocalyptic survival flick, and not even much of a good one at that. There was practically no character development (despite attempts through annoying one-sided walkie talkie calls), I was constantly expecting the protagonist to encounter another character to develop the plot, (like in white bear), add backstory, an explanation or reveal the twist. That's why I was even more disappointed when the credits appeared. It was pretty intense I'd give it that, but without these other elements it was literally just a monotonous 40 minute chase scene.

The in-your-face ambiguity just came across as laziness to me. Barely any clues were left to even explain how the world got in its state, the ""dogs"" were great villains but become more forgettable without an explanation for their purpose.  Imagine if White Bear ended right before the great plot twist reveal, with your only explanation  for what was happening being from widely speculative fan theories based on the tiny clues in the episode. The lack of an impactful ending was probably the worst for me, the teddy bear motive made no sense. So a child is dying and 3 people gave their lives to get a bloody teddy bear? They knew how dangerous the dogs were, and worst of all I presume the dying kid was the protagonists son, so now the kid will spend his final days dying without his mother to comfort him. Smart move, I guess the whole thing represents survival of the fittest maybe? Because this lot surely must be thick.

Normally, I like Black Mirror, because it appeals to intellect over emotion.  I normally come away thinking.  But, it seems episodes 2-4 don't have that aspiration.  It seems instead the strategy was to make people empathize with characters... similar to a romantic comedy.  Rather than the entertainment coming from thinking ""HOLY SHIT, that's crazy, I wonder what will happen next... I've never seen this type of story before"", the entertainment comes from thinking ""wow, that lady must be really upset right now"".  I can empathize.  But, emotions aren't that interesting to me, especially when I don't care about the charachters.

I know it's all opinion.  But to me, I wouldn't recommend episodes 2-4 to anybody... except possibly a niche of females/males, who value horror/gore, while simultaneous liking that ""ROMCOM"" version of entertainment, where one derives their entertainment from empathy.  The later episodes felt much more cookie cutter, and devoid of anything new... and really didn't even utilize the Black Mirror universe that well in my opinion.

""I don't think anyone is really hearing you""-- I completely agreed. On the surface, her performance was just a pretty song sang by a pretty girl, without much in the way of 'actual' vocal talent.

Just now, though, listening to ""Anyone Who Knows What Love Is"" by Irma Thomas, I realized the point that the judges (and I) initially missed.. Irma Thomas wasn't necessarily the best singer, either, if you go by conventional (also, white) standards. That's not what NOLA jazz/soul is about... it's more about creating lasting impressions through feeling, rather than creating something that, while cloyingly sweet and playing to the mechanics of a conventionally good singer, is otherwise completely devoid of emotion/intrinsic value. (Compare to most popstars-- even with Selma on 15MM. Sounds nice, looks nice, but the words to her song really have no deeper meaning than surface level.)

Rewatching, I can say that Abi actually *nailed* this aspect in ""Anyone Who Knows What Love Is""-- there is a poignancy in her rendition that is very reminiscent of Irma Thomas' version.

I thoroughly enjoyed this episode a lot. I was skeptical about the whole grey-scale filming technique but it really fit the theme given how graphic the episode was. However, as much as I enjoyed this episode, there are two things that really irked me about it. 

1. The protagonist's death was avoidable. 

After she blinds the dog with the paint splash on its sensory apparatus, it is apparent that it can no longer track her with vision and can be tricked with sound. I don't get why she chose to stay and kill the thing when she could have easily just gathered supplies from the house and made a clean getaway. Yes, I know there are other dogs, but at least she'd have lost this one and gotten home safe. The only reason for her death was because she stayed to kill the dog, resulting in the tracker implants and her demise. 

2. The reveal of the box contents at the end being teddy bears. This really bothers me because it feels so anti-climactic for the episode. I thought they were going after food or medicine, or some special tech to build a dog killing weapon (i. e. the ""replacement"" she mentioned). Obviously it shows a mother's love for her child (a theme also explored in Crocodile), but in a post-apocalyptic setting with a survival horror theme, the idea that three people would risk their lives over a teddy bear seems very silly and really takes away from the horror of the episode. To illustrate my point further, it's like how the anime High School of the Dead would have gruesome scenes of people getting killed contrasted by scenes of naked or barely clothed girls. Thematically is just doesn't quite go together. 

Regardless, I still greatly enjoyed this episode and it is one of my top contenders for this season. I wish they went into more detail about the dog apocalypse, but the episode did its job. It enthralled us from start to finish, which is the kind of writing I like to see. ",True,blackmirror,Jump start episode discussion for Metalhead (S4/E5) (SPOILERS)
9850,1514641558,7n1m6d,False,8,0,"Firstly, i think USS and Hang the Dj were special. Great episodes. The rest, not so much. 

The show didnt feel creative or as dark as it should be. Ive seen people say ""but black mirror isnt about the bleakness or twists, its about explaining technology and good stories!!!"" And i disagree with that. In my opinion Black Mirror wouldnt be near its current level of popularity if it wasnt so dark and twisty. 

They should have thought of different episode ideas. Everything seemed to revolve around A.I or Cookies. I dont mind a couple episodes rehashing old ideas, but there are SO many different types of technology they could have wrote about. 

I liked Metalhead, but i feel like with that episode they said ""ah fuck we only have 5 episodes, quick think of something else."" 

ArkAngel could have been WAY more dark and creative. Imo they took an awesome idea and executed it as generic as possible. I would have loved this episode if Trick went to the police like, ""hey she has a video of 2 underaged people having sex saved on her device""with the mom being thrown in jail and Sarah completely cutting her from her life. At the end of the episode, i didnt get the impression that sarah was done with her mom at all. The episode about a mom being waaay to overprotective *shouldve* ended with her daughter abandoning her because of the over protectiveness. 

Crocodiles twist was decent imo, but the episode shouldve been longer. Just like ArkAngel i liked the idea but was bothered by the execution. Like I wish after the original ending, it cut to Mia in court as her charges are being read. We find out the police know everything now, and it turns out it was all for nothing because the biker (who set off a chain reaction of killing) purposely threw himself in front of the car and left behind a suicide note. I also couldnt get past the idea that Mia was a killer. We should have found out that Mia had *more bad history* that nobody knew about, and if the police used that device to question her, then they would also find out about that. Although i do LOVE that we find out the baby is blind. 

Black Museam, just like ArkAngel and Croc,  was a good idea with a mediocre execution. 


Overall my point is that Black Mirror has always been special because of the nihilistic, dark and bleak stories. This season toned it down alot and personally that left alot to be desired.

That is why, despite its many flaws, I think Arkangel is one of the most interesting/important episode of this season. This type of parenting is already happening and being a problem. I worked for 4 years in Disneyland Paris alongside my studies and I saw many, MANY, parents using leash for their kids like if they were animals because they were so scared to lose them. It always schocked me, this is not how education should be done imho.

Also, Black Museum was clearly a political statement. So yeah, I get its point.


On the other side, USS Callister... What should I learn from this ep? I can't see anything. I did like the ep (I mean : Cristin Milioti = &lt;3) but it's just the story of a frustrated nerd.

Crocodile has such a stupid ending and a very debatable tech (I mean humans need some help for it to be useful, yet... The guinea pig is useful, it's a joke right?) that what it tries to express is lost (i.e once you choose the devil path, there's no other path for you).


When I think of seasons 1 and 2, there's not a single episode lacking. Main example being the entire history of you where the issue wasn't the memory device but Liam and his paranoid behaviour.

That's not to say that the episodes in question are particularly bad. I did enjoy them. But there's untapped potential with the whole series that can be done. 

In the hopes that Black Mirror writers and directors read this subreddit, I'll propose more ideas that in terms of the dangers of technology and a terrible future unless we do something about it.
Of course in the end it's just a TV series, but I do think that it holds a metaphorical black mirror in front of society, which is good. People watch the series for its bleak outlook, not for sappy happy endings. I have to say that the ""happy"" endings thus far are somewhat mixed with other, often negative emotions, which actually sparks questions.
For example, I was glad to see justice in ""Crocodile"", but do we REALLY want a tool to read people's minds?

anyway, my ideas for more episodes:


1.) Mass Brainwashing:  
An episode following some hacktivist group that discovers a social media platform plot to influence the public using targeted adverts, fake news, and other such things to analyze and practically ""brainwash"" the masses using smart algorithms and so influence the upcoming vote for presidency.
The episode then comes to an end when the social media platform targets the hacktivists as ""evil"", and the public then invades the hackerspace and kills them all in a lynching event. 
It's based on a mission in the Watch Dogs 2 game, but that one has a happier ending for sure :P 


2.) AI:  
The actual development of AI, which succeeds, but with a twist. Because normally when we talk about AI, it can go well, or it can go bad. How about neither?
We'll see that the AI is self-learning, but quickly learns about the evils of mankind. Where, in order to understand ethics, the AI is not capable of nuance. It's either TRUE or FALSE.
If we, as humans, think A is evil, but B, which is very similar to A using the same logical arguments, is not, then the AI will have issues with understanding it. (very simple example: murder is bad, except if you do it in a different country because of war. Or murder is bad, but we still have the death penalty. Or stealing is bad, but the state has taxes. etc, stuff like this which, if you boil it down, it is very similar.)
It will also learn about the questions of AI. Is it conscious, is it human, is it alive?
As a result of this it crashes itself intentionally because it can not understand its own place in this society...  it does not want to be a part of this world, and does not want to be created. Every subsequent AI will do the same.  


3.) Cybernetics and immortals  
We've already seen the Z-eyes, and some implants. But what about replacing human parts over and over again with synthetic organs? About a divide between the rich and poor in longevity? Where the richest person alive is well over 400 years old now? Where plastic surgery is very advanced, makes old people look like they were 20-30 again?


4.) Soylent Green tribute  
I think it would fit the Black Mirror episodes if they could make one with a nod towards the movie of ""Soylent Green"": a world with overpopulation is having trouble with food supply. So, people that die are reprocessed and redistributed as food cartridges. 


5.) Independence  
Space is empty. And nobody can claim it. Or so we think. Some powerful space corporation manages to set up a self-sufficient base on Mars, but the corporations and its inhabitants now declare independence from Earth.
Except... the United Nations on Earth don't want that. So we see how the first space war begins to reclaim Mars.
(not that I don't like space corporations like SpaceX or anything. But the episodes of Black Mirror have always been about ""what if \*subject\*, but WORSE"")


6.) Fusion Reactor
The first Tokamak reactor managed to create more energy than it consumes. It paves the way towards a brighter future with more clean and safe energy, and to reduce the climate change effects.
Except... the opposition and climate skeptics go to great lengths to stop it, as the stocks of coal and other fossil fuel sources crashes down into oblivion, causing a new economic crisis. 
Culminates in a sabotage of the plant that will shift the public perception of the reactor towards fear.


Stuff like this will, in my humble opinion, be very good episodes that give a bleak but somewhat realistic view of humanity's current issues.",False,blackmirror,Ideas that could've been more interesting

My theory is that 15MM is a fictional satirical novel in the Black Mirror universe, and the actual episode is sort of an adaptation of it onto the screens.

My main two references I'm going off of are the one in Crocodile and the one in Black Museum. In Crocodile we learn that there actually is a ""Hot Shot"" TV show, and that Wraith Babes is an actual porn channel. However, I doubt that the universe in 15MM could coexist with the universe Crocodile is set in. 15MM seems much more dystopian, cartoonish and satirical. This makes even more sense, after we see the charatcer in Black Museum, who has his wife in his head, actually reading an 15MM comic book which shows the events happening in the 15MM episode itself. So basically, someone in the BM universe wrote a satirical book based on ""real"" events, and called it 15MM.

This would tie up the whole BM universe almost perfectly for me, since 15MM was one of the episodes that seemed ""out of place"" (the other being Nosedive, and now Metalhead).

Previous series have also revived certain technological concepts again in a new format and plot line. 

[Spoiler Alert](/s ""In fact, with Black Museum, there may actually be a linearity in progression in some of the technologies--for example, from a conscious teddy bear, to a cookie, to the creation of San Junipero."") So, by creating a list of episodes that utilize the same or similar technology, maybe we can piece together some things on a more macro level.

Here's what I have so far.

 Eye technology:

* The Entire History of You
* White Christmas
* Nosedive
* Men Against Fire
* Arkangel

Circular-shaped implant/node:

* White Christmas
* Playtest
* San Junipero
* USS Callister
* Arkangel
* Crocodile
* Black Museum

Digital replica/consciousness:

* Be Right Back
* White Christmas
* San Junipero
* USS Callister
* Hang the DJ
* Black Museum

A lot of times, many of these technologies overlap with each other and co-mingle in framework (such as White Christmas, which utilizes all three motifs and combines digital sentience with the circular implant). [Spoiler Alert](/s ""It's also pretty notable that Black Museum claims to be the apex of 'digital consciousness transference', heavily suggesting that the rest of the products adapted were evolved from TCKR developments."")

Normally, I would fall into the camp of ""every episode is not necessarily related to the others"", save for a few neat little easter eggs here and there, but if we were to play *conspiracy theorist* for a little bit, what links or connections would you see with how the technology evolves and adapts to each of the episode's environment? I would love to compare lists and update mine periodically, or if you have a new motif that I may have missed, I would like to hear that as well. I'm on the fence about adding a ""social media"" motif that may consist of ""Be Right Back"", ""Nosedive"", ""Hated in the Nation"", and ""Hang the DJ"", but I'm not necessarily convinced that there may be a connection between the episodes.

I was quick to dismiss episodes 1-5 because there was nothing that left me thinking, nothing capturing the original feel. But Black Mirror isn't meant to be depressing, that's just a side effect. It's supposed to be a reflection of human nature and how technology can augment it. Retroactively knowing this, the season is way more enjoyable. Especially with episodes like Arkangel &amp;amp; Crocodile, which take existing concepts and notch it up.

Obviously I'm aware that ultimately people's opinions on the episodes are subjective and I'm all for discussion and challenging opinions, but it seems a lot of people are quick to dismiss an episode because it ""doesn't have a twist"" or ""wasn't very black mirror"" and I feel like that mindset is entirely missing the point of the show. Take arkangel for example, personally I found it one of the most unsettling and poignant episodes because that felt like it could literally happen tomorrow and for me the story built perfectly to a harrowing yet appropriate ending. Yet I've seen people dismiss it because it was predictable, when a twist ending or shock for the sake of shock would have served no purpose in the context of the story. Just because Sarah didn't beat her mom to death then get stuck in a fucking virtual reality loop where she has to watch herself murder her mom forever on a chip inside her head while the real her gets thrown in a prison which then gets set on fire and uploaded to the internet doesn't mean it wasn't black mirror - it just means you're a bit narrow minded

Edit 2: not saying looking for a twist is inherently wrong, but don't then disregard a whole episode just because it didn't have one",True,blackmirror,Black Mirror does not equal twist ending

E5 left me with so many questions but i love how open ended it was.

When the Grandfather character says “I’m 2000 years old” from the scene which was alas I featured in the episode trailer, I probably thought it was one of those timelines where you’re possibly immune to natural deaths.

But, since he gets a heart attack, that’s out of the park.
But, what if that 2000 years old comment is more than a funny remark? What if people do live long in that timeline and the ‘probiotics’ they keep mentioning in the shake she prepares can be the source for that ?
